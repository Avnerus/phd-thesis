The purpose of this study is to fill this gap by investigating the role of cultural values in perceptions of privacy, trust and motivations for using Facebook among young Palestinians in Israel. We relied on Hall's concept of high and low communication contexts and three of Hofstede's cultural dimensions: collectivism, power distance and uncertainty avoidance. Data from a survey of Arab high school students (N = 567) established that variations in the adoption of cultural values are associated with the motivation for using Facebook through their effect on trust and on privacy concerns. We discuss the findings and their implications.},

We identify a set of (17) constructs that we investigate in the context of Facebook, e.g., enjoyment, relationship maintenance, awareness, trust, privacy concerns, education, family ties, and gender perception. To measure the effect of culture on these constructs, we conducted a survey with around (190) distinct questions in total that we distributed among Palestinian Facebook users to identify their tendency of Facebook usage. We gathered 580 valid participation in our survey. Our results show that religion affects how Palestinian users use Facebook. Our results also show a clear impact of gender perception on the behavior of Facebook users in Palestine. Moreover, our respondents indicate a correlation between using Facebook and ruining family ties and relationships.},

Methods: This online community-based cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted between 19 April 2020 and 5 June 2020, using a validated questionnaire. The questionnaire comprised of three sections: sociodemographic characteristics, living conditions, and impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. A convenience sampling method was used to select participants. Results: A total of 570 adults aged ⩾18\,years participated in the study. Of them, 258 (45.3\%), 120 (21\%), and 192 (33.7\%) were residing in the Gaza Strip, West Bank, and East Jerusalem, respectively. A large portion of participants (73.2\%) reported that the containment measures of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic had caused an excessive burden on their families; 549 (96.3\%) revealed that water supplies were not always available at home. However, paying attention to personal hygiene and home cleaning was more than usual before the announcement of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. The mean times of going out of their homes have dropped significantly following the onset of the pandemic, p value\,=\,0.001 (95\% confidence interval). In addition, 192 (33.7\%) participants reported that they changed to working remotely from home with 66 (11.6\%) having lost their employment. Conclusion: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic was associated with an additional burden on the Palestinian families. Moreover, we suggest discussing the obtained results with local and national stakeholders to ensure that they know to improve their actions.},

  abstract = {This paper considers psychotic symptoms in terms of false inferences or beliefs. It is based on the notion that the brain is an inference machine that actively constructs hypotheses to explain or predict its sensations. This perspective provides a normative (Bayes-optimal) account of action and perception that emphasizes probabilistic representations; in particular, the confidence or precision of beliefs about the world. We will consider hallucinosis, abnormal eye movements, sensory attenuation deficits, catatonia, and delusions as various expressions of the same core pathology: namely, an aberrant encoding of precision. From a cognitive perspective, this represents a pernicious failure of metacognition (beliefs about beliefs) that can confound perceptual inference. In the embodied setting of active (Bayesian) inference, it can lead to behaviors that are paradoxically more accurate than Bayes-optimal behavior. Crucially, this normative account is accompanied by a neuronally plausible process theory based upon hierarchical predictive coding. In predictive coding, precision is thought to be encoded by the post-synaptic gain of neurons reporting prediction error. This suggests that both pervasive trait abnormalities and florid failures of inference in the psychotic state can be linked to factors controlling post-synaptic gain -- such as NMDA receptor function and (dopaminergic) neuromodulation. We illustrate these points using biologically plausible simulations of perceptual synthesis, smooth pursuit eye movements and attribution of agency -- that all use the same predictive coding scheme and pathology: namely, a reduction in the precision of prior beliefs, relative to sensory evidence.},

In response to such misguided assumptions, this article attempts to reformulate the common and perhaps unfortunate thinking about African practices of design in HCI4D -- i.e., largely as a function of African societal predicaments and Western technocratic resolutions. Through critical reflection on a range of issues associated with post-colonialism and post-development, I examine the possibilities that various historical tropes might offer to the reinvention of the African perspective on innovation. This leads to the consideration of how engaging in critical discussions about the future dimensions of African HCI can allow for grappling with the effect of the coloniality of being, power, and knowledge. Developing on the ideas of futuring as a way of dealing with the complexities of the present---in this case, the coloniality of the imagination---the article ends by discussing three tactical propositions for ``remembering'' future identities of African innovation where the values of autonomy are known and acted upon.},

However, it is unclear what types of outgroups are likely to be targeted when an external threat is taking its toll. In this study, we examine two types of outgroups that might be at risk of becoming victims of intergroup hostility. The first is the ``ultimate scapegoat'' outgroup which has a long history of negative relations with the ingroup. The second is the "context-dependent" outgroup which is viewed as an outgroup only in certain contexts. We utilized the COVID-19 crisis and the highly diverse social makeup of Israeli society to explore the extent to which each type of outgroup would be targeted. Results from our study (N~=~664), conducted during the first peak of COVID-19 in Israel, show that higher levels of exposure to COVID-19 predicted lower willingness to aid outgroups and that outgroup dehumanization mediated this association. However, this held true only when the target outgroup was a context-dependent outgroup. When the target group was the ultimate scapegoat, exposure to COVID-19 did not predict ingroup willingness to aid them. Our findings contribute to our theoretical and practical knowledge on how intergroup hostility proliferates during external threats and, as such, are valuable to scholars, practitioners, and policymakers working to reduce intergroup tensions during large-scale crises.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the impact of labor mobility restrictions such as border closures, physical obstacles and unequally accessed ID cards and work permits on the labor flows of West Bank residents. The results demonstrate that for Jerusalem residents, mobility restrictions reduce out-migration but they are much more pronounced in impeding out-migration to Israel proper than to Israeli settlements. Additionally, an increase in the number of border closures per quarter has a positive and significant impact on the odds of facing unemployment for all groups, but is especially high for migrant workers residing outside of Jerusalem. A lower bound estimate of the economic cost of a 50day increase in the number of border closures (1.78 standard deviations) per quarter is about USD 1.7 million per day in the subsequent quarter. The paper also concludes that the determinants of out-migration differ from those of return-migration. For example, while border closures and unemployment status during previous visits are strong determinants of out-migration, the decision to return is driven by relatively low wages and lacking the necessary legal documentation to enter Israel. The findings in this paper are consistent with international studies that ascribe inefficiency in labor markets to restrictions on labor mobility across regions.},

It utilises the analytical notion of peace gaps to accentuate the interplay between local and elite levels. It also highlights the discrepancies when it comes to expectations of peace, the ability to communicate peace discourses and the power to influence and build wider domestic peace constituencies. The empirical findings reveal how current vertical and horizontal peace gaps result in the disempowerment and marginalisation of local peace NGOs on both sides. Such a precarious situation hinders broader peace mobilisation and is further exacerbated by widespread political apathy and peace fatigue among Israeli and Palestinian publics. By way of conclusion, the article argues for the need to re-politicise and re-negotiate space for a more agonistic peacebuilding, which allows for differences to co-exist.},

As such, four backdrops are engaged to further the methodological, theoretical, and curricular/pedagogical force of jokering as a performance that unsettles the status quo: Latina/Chicana feminist theories used in mentoring, performance-based action research with middle-school students, professional leadership development for schools, and socio-technological analysis with theatre in online/distance education. Each example from our praxis illustrates how the roles of emerging researcher, mentor-researcher, and researcher-practitioner are performed and troubled (jokered) from different disciplinary and theoretical perspectives to foster social justice praxis and outcomes.},

  abstract = {Blending autoethnographic approaches with critical analysis, this article explores the intersection of arts-based praxis in peacebuilding and development in peace studies and conflict resolution (PS/CR). In recent decades, arts-based approaches have emerged across the globe in post-conflict settings. Applied, or process, theatre constitutes a social ontology, analysing and digesting experiences and an acceptance of multiple methods that inform research, theory, and practice. Similar to experiential education, applied theatre methodology connects research, theory, and practice in an integrative setting, but how does it resonate with PS/CR in practice? How can peace practitioners access arts-based praxis in development efforts? What benefits do such approaches provide? The author proposes that applied theatre principles, inspired by Augusto Boal and his system called Theatre of the Oppressed, can strengthen existing connections between peace education and peacebuilding practice, whilst also providing opportunities to enhance leader and learner benefit through active engagement in various settings.},

We performed user studies with 28 older adults with two different assistive training robots: an adaptive robot, and a non-adaptive robot, in two countries (Sweden and Israel). In the adaptive robot group, the robot suggested playing music and decreased the number of repetitions based on the participant's level of engagement. We analyzed the facial expressions of the participants in these two groups. Results revealed that older adults in the adaptive robot group showed more varying facial expressions. The adaptive robot created a distraction for the older adults since it talked more than the non-adaptive robot. This result suggests that a robot designed for older adults should utilize the right amount of communication capabilities. The Israeli participants expressed more positive attitudes towards robots and rated the perceived usefulness of the robot higher than the Swedish participants.},

The results support all formulated hypotheses. The proposed model in this study explains 69\% of individual's attitude or feelings towards adoption the SNSs, 59\% of the variance in ``Behavioral Intention'' and 54\% of the variance in ``Usage Behaviour''. The present study has shown the importance of social presence's factors, namely co-presence, intimacy, and immediacy, in explaining individuals' intentions and behavior. The study findings confirmed that social presence positively influence SNS usage indirectly through user attitude, and as aforementioned that three factors, namely co-presence, intimacy, and immediacy are framing the construct of social presence. Thus, this study is the first empirical effort to examine the impact of co-presence, intimacy, and immediacy in determining intention or behaviour.},

  abstract = {The spread of ideas is a fundamental concern of today's news ecology. Understanding the dynamics of the spread of information and its co-option by interested parties is of critical importance. Research on this topic has shown that individuals tend to cluster in echo-chambers and are driven by confirmation bias. In this paper, we leverage the active inference framework to provide an in silico model of confirmation bias and its effect on echo-chamber formation. We build a model based on active inference, where agents tend to sample information in order to justify their own view of reality, which eventually leads to them to have a high degree of certainty about their own beliefs. We show that, once agents have reached a certain level of certainty about their beliefs, it becomes very difficult to get them to change their views. This system of self-confirming beliefs is upheld and reinforced by the evolving relationship between an agent's beliefs and observations, which over time will continue to provide evidence for their ingrained ideas about the world. The epistemic communities that are consolidated by these shared beliefs, in turn, tend to produce perceptions of reality that reinforce those shared beliefs. We provide an active inference account of this community formation mechanism. We postulate that agents are driven by the epistemic value that they obtain from sampling or observing the behaviours of other agents. Inspired by digital social networks like Twitter, we build a generative model in which agents generate observable social claims or posts (e.g., `tweets') while reading the socially observable claims of other agents that lend support to one of two mutually exclusive abstract topics. Agents can choose which other agent they pay attention to at each timestep, and crucially who they attend to and what they choose to read influences their beliefs about the world. Agents also assess their local network's perspective, influencing which kinds of posts they expect to see other agents making. The model was built and simulated using the freely available Python package pymdp. The proposed active inference model can reproduce the formation of echo-chambers over social networks, and gives us insight into the cognitive processes that lead to this phenomenon.},

  abstract = {With recent interest in shape-changing interfaces, material-driven design, wearable technologies, and soft robotics, digital fabrication of soft actuatable material is increasingly in demand. Much of this research focuses on elastomers or non-stretchy air bladders. Computationally-controlled machine knitting offers an alternative fabrication technology which can rapidly produce soft textile objects that have a very different character: breathable, lightweight, and pleasant to the touch. These machines are well established and optimized for the mass production of garments, but compared to other digital fabrication techniques such as CNC machining or 3D printing, they have received much less attention as general purpose fabrication devices. In this work, we explore new ways to employ machine knitting for the creation of actuated soft objects. We describe the basic operation of this type of machine, then show new techniques for knitting tendon-based actuation into objects. We explore a series of design strategies for integrating tendons with shaping and anisotropic texture design. Finally, we investigate different knit material properties, including considerations for motor control and sensing.},

  abstract = {Since the launching of the Oslo peace process in 1993, the term `normalization' has been used to characterize policies that aim to recognize the state of Israel and to establish `normal' relations between Israelis and Palestinians. Whereas the Palestinian Authority has been supportive of normalization policies, numerous domestic and international critics have argued that these policies serve to perpetuate occupation and its consequences. We examine how Palestinians understand normalization, to what degree they support various forms of `normalizing' relations with Israelis, and how contact with Israelis relates to support for normalization and motivation for revolutionary resistance against the occupation. Based on a cross-sectional survey conducted among an adult sample (N = 159) in the West Bank in 2016, we show that the understanding of normalization was multi-faceted, and that support for contact and collaboration across group lines (i.e., with Israelis) depended on the type of intergroup relations. On average, respondents were more supportive of relations within the political sphere, e.g. civilian policies and diplomatic coordination, than of interpersonal contact, cultural cooperation or security coordination. Support for most types of intergroup relations was related to decreased motivation for revolutionary resistance. In line with research on `sedative' effects of positive intergroup contact in historically unequal societies, we found that past positive contact with Israelis was linked to decrease in Palestinians' motivation for revolutionary resistance through increased support for interpersonal contact and security coordination as forms of normalization.},

  abstract = {This article examines how Palestinians' intergroup contact experiences relate to their attitudes towards interactions with Israelis (i.e., normalization). We draw on four recent advances in intergroup contact literature. First, recent research indicates that positive contact can impede disadvantaged groups' motivation to challenge inequalities. Second, increased endorsement of normalization mediates this sedative effect of positive contact on motivation to resist in the West Bank. Third, negative contact has been related to increased motivation for social change. Fourth, institutions and societal norms shape the meaning of intergroup contact and its effect on intergroup relations. We hypothesize that negative experiences at checkpoints can act as reminders of institutionalized inequalities and thus attenuate sedative effects. Furthermore, we explore the contextual boundary conditions of such reminder effects. Analyses of cross-sectional survey conducted among a representative sample (N = 1,000) in the West Bank including Jerusalem showed that (1) positive intergroup contact related to normalization endorsement (sedative effect), (2) negative intergroup contact related to decreased normalization endorsement (mobilizing effect), and (3) negative contact experiences (at checkpoints) canceled out the effect of positive contact (reminder effect), but only in Jerusalem. Results suggest that the impacts of intergroup contact need to be interpreted in light of institutionalized forms of group inequality and segregation.},

Avatar identification is one potential moderator. We integrated three lines of research on moral disengagement, moral foundations, and avatar identification to conceptually replicate and extend previous studies on video games and morality. We used a 2 (justification: unjustified vs. justified violence) x 2 (avatar: high vs. low identification) between-participants experiment with guilt, moral cleansing, and post-play sacredness of the care and fairness foundations as moral outcomes. Participants (N = 233) also completed measures of morally-relevant traits before gameplay. Participants felt guiltier after unjustified (vs. justified) violence. People with high trait levels of care foundation salience and personal distress also felt guiltier. Unjustified (vs. justified) violence did not affect the other moral outcomes. Avatar identification did not moderate the effects of unjustified violence, but this is likely because participants identified less with their avatars after engaging in unjustified violence. This unexpected effect suggests that players distance themselves from immoral avatars. Theoretical implications are discussed.},

There are two types of human psychological experiences to consider in robot-mediated interactions: (1) telepresence, in which a user develops a sense of being present near the remote interlocutor, and (2) co-presence, in which a user perceives the other person as being present locally with him or her. This work presents a literature review on developments supporting robotic social interactions, contributing to improving the sense of presence and co-presence via robot mediation. This survey aims to define social presence, co-presence, identify autonomous ``user-adaptive systems'' for social robots, and propose a taxonomy for ``co-presence'' mechanisms. It presents an overview of social robotics systems, applications areas, and technical methods and provides directions for telepresence and co-presence robot design given the actual and future challenges. Finally, we suggest evaluation guidelines for these systems, having as reference face-to-face interaction.},

We discuss using such agents in terms of situatedness, environment, context awareness, and social, human-like face-to-face interaction with robots where subtle nonverbal and social facial signals can be communicated. At the end of the chapter, we present a recent application of Furhat as a multimodal multiparty interaction system that was presented at the London Science Museum as part of a robot festival,.

Recent advances have enabled such experiences through cloud-based infrastructure; however, this is not currently possible on most mobile robots due to the need to access cloud-based (remote) AI technology. Here we describe a toolkit that supports interactive avatars using cloud-based resources for human-robot interaction. The toolkit deals with communication and rendering latency through parallelization and mechanisms that obscure delays. This technology can be used to put an interactive face on a mobile robot. But does an animated face on a robot actually make the interaction more effective or useful? To answer this question, we conducted a user study comparing human-robot interaction using text, audio, a realistic avatar, and a simplistic cartoon avatar. Although response time was longer for both avatar interfaces (due to increased computation and communication), this had no significant effect on participant satisfaction with the avatar-based interfaces. When asked about general preferences, more participants preferred the audio interface over the text interface, the avatar interfaces over the audio interface, and the realistic avatar interface over the cartoon avatar interface.

Given that most research on data, as well as its area of application, have focused on and is informed by the Global North, this workshop sets the spotlight on Latin America and places activist and academic knowledge on equal standing. The organisers are an interdisciplinary group of Latin American scholars and activists, women based in the North and the South, engaging with data across the borderlands of disciplines, practices, migrations, and languages. By hosting the workshop in Spanish (with English interpretation), the organisers aim to create a space where Latin American voices are heard and appreciated, without requiring English profciency from speakers and participants. We invite the CHI community to cross the borders and join a diferent conversation, including panels and interactive sessions that will inspire --- and challenge --- current thinking around data and data practices.},

  abstract = {YOLO is a non-anthropomorphic social robot designed to stimulate creativity in children. This robot was envisioned to be used by children during free-play where they use the robot as a character for the stories they create. During play, YOLO makes use of creativity techniques that promote the creation of new story-lines. Therefore, the robot serves as a tool that has the potential to stimulate creativity in children during the interaction. Particularly, YOLO can stimulate divergent and convergent thinking for story creations. Additionally, YOLO can have different personalities, providing it with socially intelligent and engaging behaviors. This work provides open-source and open-access of YOLO's hardware. The design of the robot was guided by psychological theories and models on creativity, design research including user-centered design practices with children, and informed by expert working in the field of creativity. Specifically, we relied on established theories of personality to inform the social behavior of the robot, and on theories of creativity to design creativity stimulating behaviors. Our design decisions were then based on design fieldwork with children. The end product is a robot that communicates using non-verbal expressive modalities (lights and movements) equipped with sensors that detect the playful behaviors of children. YOLO has the potential to be used as a research tool for academic studies, and as a toy for the community to engage in personal fabrication. The overall benefit of this proposed hardware is that it is open-source, less expensive than existing ones, and one that children can build by themselves under expert supervision.},

This article details the artificial intelligence software developed for YOLO. The implemented software schedules through several Creativity Behaviors to find the ones that stimulate creativity more effectively. YOLO can choose between convergent and divergent thinking techniques, two important processes of creative thought. These techniques were developed based on the psychological theories of creativity development and on research from creativity experts who work with children. Besides promoting creativity, this software allows the creation of Social Behaviors that enable the robot to behave as a believable character. We built 3 main social behavior parameters: Exuberant, Aloof, and Harmonious. These behaviors are meant to ease immersive play and the process of character creation. The 3 social behaviors were based on psychological theories of personality and developed using children's input during co-design studies. Overall, this work presents the design, development, and usage of social robots that might nurture intrinsic human abilities, such as the ability to be creative.},

Particularly, this study examined the interplay between avatar customization, the salience of a common ingroup identity, and verbal mimicry in 54 VR dyads comprising users from different ethnic backgrounds. Participants were asked to customize their avatars to look either like themselves or someone completely different. Participants interacted wearing either similar avatar uniforms (salient common identity) or different clothes (nonsalient identity). The linguistic style matching (LSM) algorithm was employed to calculate verbal mimicry in the communication exchanged during a joint task. The results suggested that verbal mimicry significantly predicted lesser social distance and greater social attraction towards the outgroup member. These results are discussed in terms of their contribution for potential intergroup models of avatar communication in immersive virtual environments (IVEs).},

  abstract = {Intergroup conflicts are a major scourge across the world, leading to death, injury and pain as well as a huge societal and economic impact. One of the leading theories advocated for conflict resolution and prevention is the Contact Hypothesis (Allport, 1954). According to this theory, contact under certain conditions will create a positive intergroup encounter, which in turn, will reduce prejudice and discrimination, and bring about an improvement in intergroup relations. Although the Internet has become an accessible and pivotal medium of communication there are surprisingly few projects that make use of its potential for bridging between groups in conflict. This article explains how the Internet's unique qualities may help overcome the major obstacles inherent in the Contact Hypothesis. In doing so, it differentiates between structured and unstructured online intergroup contact, and provides an analysis of some of the leading online intergroup contact platforms, both past and present. The paper concludes with suggestions for future research in this field.},

The program was designed to progress gradually, starting from basic and leading to a deeper acquaintance, using a variety of computer-mediated communication (CMC) tools. Findings indicated that upon program completion, participants were more respectful towards one another than pre-program. They held a positive view of online learning and were open to multiculturalism (more tolerant and accepting of others than previously) while still maintaining their respective cultural identities. The program participants noticed the gradual progression in task design, expressly noting that this stepwise structure supported forging a connection and then fostering familiarization. This study fills a gap in the research through demonstrating ways that online contact (indirect contact) can be used to promote acquaintance and reduce stereotypes and prejudices among teachers from different groups in Israeli society.},

Prior to the large-scale implementation of a complex ERP system, one of the groups consisted of experienced ICT users, while the other consisted of inexperienced users. The significance of the nature of the interplay between task-technology fit, the leadership and the ICT-organization integration processes, and employees' levels of self-determination, is investigated in relation to different user practices, and in particular, how it may institutionalize involuntary non-use for the group of inexperienced employees. Previous experience is a moderating variable, together with participation and interaction possibilities in everyday work. In a perspective of sociomateriality where user practices are seen as developing through situated everyday actions and interactions, the relationship between demands, control and support and inherent need satisfaction is elaborated. This study shows that employees' use or non-use of new ICT has to do with how leadership behaviors affect the ICT-organization integration process and its outcomes, and how this process may serve the experienced employee group over the inexperienced, and as such contribute to involuntary non-use of new ICT for the latter.},

However, the number of commercial solutions using RL is limited, one reason being the complexity related to the design of RL. Therefore, a method to identify complexities of RL for industrial applications is presented in this thesis. It was used on 15 applications inspired from four industrial companies. Complexity was especially identified in relation to the reward functions. Thus two Linear Inverse RL (IRL) algorithms in which the reward function is represented as a linear combination of features, was tested using expert data. Some of the tests indicated a visual better result than tests carried out using RL. The process of designing features shared similarities with the process of designing a reward function. The added complexity of implementing Linear IRL and constructing expert data is thus not always a simpler approach. The IRL method GAIL, which requires no feature construction, was furthermore tested showing potential.},

The aim is to establish a terrain and language of ``minor case studies.'' Deleuze denies two-world ontologies and the ontologically status of single bodies, emphasizing instead how assemblages of human and non-human bodies together produce the world. In this terrain, cases are not objects of inquiry, but life-giving forces that create movement. This in turn changes the premises for how we can approach and explore cases. Rather than represent, comment and explain what cases are, we illustrate how a case-assemblage creates possibilities for event-based thinking regarding interesting phenomena (cases), and how these cases are twisted, stretched and pulled out of a conventional case study design. We conclude by discussing epistemological consequences of new materialist ontology.},

In the present work, participants conveyed eight emotions to a small humanoid robot via touch. We found that female participants conveyed emotions for a longer time, using more varied interaction and touching more regions on the robot's body, compared to male participants. Several differences between emotions were found such that emotions could be classified by the valence of the emotion conveyed, by combining touch amount and duration. Overall, these results show high agreement with those reported for human--human affective tactile communication and could also have impact on the design and placement of tactile sensors on humanoid robots.},

  abstract = {Background: Although telehealth is considered a key component in combating the worldwide crisis caused by COVID-19, the factors that influence its acceptance by the general population after the flattening of the COVID-19 curve remain unclear. Objective: We aimed to identify factors affecting telehealth acceptance, including anxiety related to COVID-19, after the initial rapid spread of the disease in South Korea. Methods: We proposed an extended technology acceptance model (TAM) and performed a cross-sectional survey of individuals aged {$\geq$}30 years. In total, 471 usable responses were collected. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to examine the validity of measurements, and the partial least squares (PLS) method was used to investigate factors influencing telehealth acceptance and the impacts of COVID-19. Results: PLS analysis showed that increased accessibility, enhanced care, and ease of telehealth use had positive effects on its perceived usefulness (P=.002, P\&lt;.001, and P\&lt;.001, respectively). Furthermore, perceived usefulness, ease, and privacy/discomfort significantly impacted the acceptance of telehealth (P\&lt;.001, P\&lt;.001, and P\&lt;.001, respectively). However, anxiety toward COVID-19 was not associated with telehealth acceptance (P=.112), and this insignificant relationship was consistent in the cluster (n=216, 46\%) of respondents with chronic diseases (P=.185). Conclusions: Increased accessibility, enhanced care, usefulness, ease of use, and privacy/discomfort are decisive variables affecting telehealth acceptance in the Korean general population, whereas anxiety about COVID-19 is not. This study may lead to a tailored promotion of telehealth after the pandemic subsides.},

Analogous to RL, IRL is perceived both as a problem and as a class of methods. By categorically surveying the current literature in IRL, this article serves as a reference for researchers and practitioners of machine learning and beyond to understand the challenges of IRL and select the approaches best suited for the problem on hand. The survey formally introduces the IRL problem along with its central challenges such as the difficulty in performing accurate inference and its generalizability, its sensitivity to prior knowledge, and the disproportionate growth in solution complexity with problem size. The article elaborates how the current methods mitigate these challenges. We further discuss the extensions to traditional IRL methods for handling: inaccurate and incomplete perception, an incomplete model, multiple reward functions, and nonlinear reward functions. This survey concludes the discussion with some broad advances in the research area and currently open research questions.},

I draw from past fieldwork with activist organizations and radical organizing literature to explore opportunities for how to engage with justice as academics, identifying three main opportunities for intervention through research: social relationships, resource distribution, and counter-institutions.

To begin this exploration, we conducted two critical making workshops with participants who self-identified as activists and used craft materials  --  such as cardboard, color markers, pipe cleaners, etc. -- to create speculative technologies to find commonalities across different forms of activist work, be it technological, organizational, or procedural. The needs and concerns expressed in the workshops were articulated through the participants' designs; they materialized their critiques, reflections, and explorations through their crafted prototypes. These prototypes point to opportunities for creating new design interventions to address the challenges and needs unique to activist organizations. The work suggests the need for more value-sensitivity and context-appropriateness in the design of interactive systems.},

Reflecting on a participatory art project with young people of African and British heritage in northeast England, we argue that discussion and practice around participatory action research, including the deployment of contact zones as theory and method, can cast some light on what fosters transformative spaces. Through analysis of two different approaches to community art used in the project, we show how elements of each enabled and disabled meaningful interaction between young people. We draw attention to the materiality of art (the tools) within participatory practices (the doing of it) in contributing to a space where interactions might take place, emphasising a complex interplay across/between actors, materials, and space that frames encounters as emergent, transitory, fragile, and yet hopeful. We examine the potential of a focus on the material in thinking beyond moments of encounter to how transformative social relations may be `scaled up' before considering the implications for research and policy.},

I examine the connections between neuroscience and puppetry which suggest that attitude-taking engenders empathy, and compare this to my own puppetry training practice to suggest that training for and engaging in puppetry practice can encourage and stimulate empathy. This in turn has significance for practitioners of puppetry working in healthcare contexts, and for medical practitioners who undertake some form of puppetry, either within their training or as continuing professional development. Although the different forms of empathy are connected in practice, the article focuses especially on affective (emotional), cognitive and social empathy.},

The study critically examines these initial rulings, identifying the compelling arguments presented by the Court and comparing it to some other recent cases such as Nicaragua v. Germany. Employing a legal analytical methodology, the piece argues for the significant judicial implications of the icj's preliminary findings and offers a tentative forecast for the expected main judgment. It further delves into the proper qualification of the crime of genocide as well as its characterization as a human rights law violation, providing the author's perspective on the seriousness of the genocide allegations from both sides involved in this critical case. This study contributes to the existing scholarly literature on the Israeli-Hamas War and the broader Israeli--Palestinian conflict, emphasizing judicial aspects and the substantive part of international criminal law, specifically the crime of genocide. It aims to serve as a valuable resource for international law scholars, legal practitioners, academics, and students engaged in the complexities of state and individual criminal responsibility within the context of international law.},

This progress has motivated researchers to design dancing robots that can mimic the complexity and style of human choreographic dancing. Such complicated actions are usually programmed manually and ad hoc. However, this approach is both tedious and inflexible. Researchers at the University of Tokyo have developed the learning-from-observation (LFO) training method to overcome this difficulty.1-2 LFO enables a robot to acquire knowledge of what to do and how to do it from observing human demonstrations. Direct mapping from human joint angles to robot joint angles doesn't work well because of the dynamic and kinematic differences between the observed person and the robot (for example, weight, balance, and arm and leg lengths). LFO therefore relies on predesigned task models, which represent only the actions (and features thereof) that are essential to mimicry. Then it adapts these actions to the robot's morphology and dynamics so that it can mimic the movement. This indirect, two-step mapping is crucial for robust imitation and performance.},

The canvases can be applied in different parts of the design process to facilitate collaboration between experts of different fields, as well as to incorporate prospective users of the robot into the design process. We investigate the usability of the proposed canvases with two social robot design case studies: a robot that played games online with teenage users and a librarian robot that guided users at a public library. We observe through participants' feedback that the canvases have the advantages of (1) providing structure, clarity, and a clear process to the design; (2) encouraging designers and users to share their viewpoints to progress toward a shared one; and (3) providing an educational and enjoyable design experience for the teams.},

Seeing images of large groups resulted in greater implicit dehumanization compared with images depicting small groups. Moreover, after viewing images of large groups, participants showed increased preference for more dominant, less trustworthy political leaders and supported less prorefugee policies and more anti-refugee policies. Lastly, the extent to which participants felt reduced pity for images depicting large groups mediated the effect of visual framing on the choice of more authoritarian leaders.

Objectives: The purpose of this study was to investigate the factors affecting the acceptance of e-books among students of lessprivileged areas such as Shahrekord. Methods: In this descriptive, analytical study, 371 students of Shahrekord University were selected through simple random sampling. The research instrument was a researcher-made questionnaire consisting of 48 questions that was designed with the help of research literature related to the technology acceptance model and interviews with five educational technology experts. Data were analyzed using ANOVA, Independent t-test, multiple regression and Pearson correlation tests. Results: Cultural factors had a significant impact on users' attitudes and their use of e-books. A significant relationship was observed between the components of usefulness, ease of use, perceived enjoyment, cultural influences and attitude with the acceptance of e-books (P {$<$} 0.001). Also, the best predictors of acceptance and use of e-books were the components of perceived enjoyment, barriers, cultural influences, and attitudes. Conclusions: The results regarding the identification of the factors affecting the acceptance of e-books can be used in virtual, nonformal and distance learning centers to design primary and supplementary educational resources. Design engineers and e-book providers can also use the findings of the current research to improve and promote electronic products.},

Methods: Respondents completed a survey that included the Negative Attitudes Toward Robots Scale (NARS) and two questions taken or modified from the European Commission's Autonomous System 2015 Report. Analyses were conducted to compare perceptions and demographic factors by age groups (young adults:18--44, middle-aged adults: 45--64, and older adults: {$>$}65 years old). Findings: Sample included 499 individuals (n\,=\,322 age 18--44 years, n\,=\,50 age 45--64 years, and n\;=\;102 age 65--98 years). There were no significant differences between age groups for 9 of the 11 items regarding social impact of robots and comfort with robots. There were no significant differences by age groups for 9 of the 14 items in the NARS. Among those items with statistically significant differences, the mean scores indicate similar sentiments for each group. Conclusions: Older, middle-\-aged, and younger adults had similar attitudes regarding the social impact of and comfort with robots; they also had similar negative attitudes towards robots. Findings dispel current perceptions that older adults are not as receptive to robots as other adults. This has implications for nurses who integrate supportive robots in their practice.},

  abstract = {While recent research has started to pay more attention to the role of contact strategies on promoting intergroup harmony between Turkish and Kurdish communities, the effectiveness of a novel form of indirect contact strategy, E-\-contact---\-where participants engage in a cooperative and structured online interaction with an individual from the outgroup---\-has not yet been tested. Across two studies (NStudy 1 = 110, NStudy 2 = 176), we investigated the effects of E-\-contact among Turks on promoting positive attitudes and behavioral tendencies toward Kurds, testing outgroup trust and intergroup anxiety as mediators and incorporating a distinction between lower and higher self-\-disclosure conditions. As expected, E-\-contact led to more positive outgroup attitudes, as well as greater approach tendencies and decreased avoidance tendencies through increased outgroup trust (Studies 1 and 2) and reduced intergroup anxiety (Study 2). Study 2 also found that E-\-contact produced lower perceived interethnic conflict through increased outgroup trust. While both lower and higher personal disclosure conditions provided similar effects in the two studies, E-\-contact with heightened self-\-disclosure was especially effective at promoting more positive outgroup attitudes and reducing avoidance tendencies. Findings highlight potential benefits of using E-\-contact as a prejudice-\-reduction strategy in conflict settings.},

To understand the audience's experiences, we conducted in-depth interviews to study which design factors and elements prompted reflexive thoughts and feelings. Our findings highlight how the audience experience was impacted by four reflexive dimensions: abstract and minimal aesthetics, everyday materials and textures, the restriction of control, and multiple, disembodied points of view. We use our findings to discuss how these dimensions can inform the design of VR storytelling experiences that provoke self and social reflection.},

In both studies, participant gender, virtual human gender, virtual human gaze behavior, and whether virtual humans were allegedly controlled by humans (i.e., avatars) or computers (i.e., agents) were varied. Results indicated that participants maintained greater distance from virtual humans when approaching their fronts compared to their backs. In addition, participants gave more personal space to virtual agents who engaged them in mutual gaze. Moreover, when virtual humans invaded their personal space, participants moved farthest from virtual human agents. The advantages and disadvantages of IVET for the study of human behavior are discussed.},

In 2020, the Covid-19 pandemic forced a drastic increase in the number of videoconference meetings, and Zoom became the leading software package because it was free, robust, and easy to use. While the software has been an essential tool for productivity, learning, and social interaction, something about being on videoconference all day seems particularly exhausting, and the term ``Zoom Fatigue'' caught on quickly. In this article, I focus on nonverbal overload as a potential cause for fatigue, and provide four arguments outlining how various aspects of the current Zoom interface likely lead to psychological consequences. The arguments are based on academic theory and research, but also have yet to be directly tested in the context of Zoom, and require future experimentation to confirm. Instead of indicting the medium, my goal is to point out these design flaws to isolate research areas for social scientists and to suggest design improvements for technologists.},

Moving from reflections on institutional critique and impact to concrete analyses of moments of unsolicited, delicate participation and refusal, the book examines a range of artistic practices from India, Sudan, Guatemala and El Salvador, the Lebanon, the Netherlands and Germany. It proposes the concept of the gesture as a way of theorising participatory art, situating it between the visual and the performing arts, as both individual and collective, both internal attitude and social habitude},

  abstract = {The article brings together observations and insights on the emerging phenomenon of training the trainers, also known as joker training in the Theatre of the Oppressed (TO). The concerns raised in this article are twofold: first, how does the modularised, workshop format of joker training affect the core principles of TO? Second, what are the implications of professionalising the work of the joker? These questions relate to the critique of `creative industries' and debates around precarisation that profoundly impact arts and humanities education in contemporary Europe. They also serve as a call to interrogate concepts central to TO, such as participation, empowerment and community, in terms of how these concepts are appropriated and made docile in the increasingly neoliberal environment of European cultural and educational policies. The article proposes that a training in TO must view the dissemination of techniques and methods of joker practice as inseparable from a deep commitment to a `conscientised' understanding of the complex social problems that the theatre seeks to address. The focus on a technical training alone bears the danger of reinforcing Freire's `banking method' of pedagogy, which is counterproductive to the political objectives of TO. The article observes that professional jokers work in precarious conditions far removed from the promises of the economic rewards of creative enterprise. The proliferation of project-based freelance work creates a situation where jokers tend to become de-territorialised and alienated from actual problems, thus propagating biographic and short-term approaches to systemic contradictions. The study aims to problematise these issues and contribute to a debate that might lead to politically and professionally viable paths for the future of TO.},

  abstract = {The scientific process plays out in a multi-scale system comprising subsystems, each with their own properties and dynamics. For the practice of science to generate useful world models---and lead to the development of enabling technologies---practicing scientists, their theories, methods, dissemination, and infrastructure (e.g., funding and laboratories) must all fit together in an orchestrated manner. Scientific practice has broad societal implications that go beyond mere scientific progress: we base our decisions on theoretical (i.e., models and forecasts) and technological (e.g., vaccines and smartphones) scientific advances. This paper applies the free energy principle to provide a multi-scale description of science understood as evidence-seeking processes in a nested hierarchy of living (biological and behavioural) and epistemic (linguistic) structures. This allows us to naturalise the scientific process---as distributed self-evidencing---in terms of dynamics that can be read as inference or Bayesian belief updating; i.e., processes that maximize the evidence for a generative model of the sensed and measured world. The ensuing meta-theoretical approach dispels the notion of science as truth-pointing and foregrounds inference to the best explanation---as evinced by the beliefs of scientists and their encultured niche. Crucially, it furnishes a way of simulating the practice of science, which may have a foundational role in the next generation of augmented intelligence systems. Epistemologically, it also addresses some key questions; e.g., is science a special? And in what ways is scientific pursuit an existential imperative for all beings? These questions may be foundational in how we use and design intelligent systems.},

I define such an attempt to apply the FEP's epistemological and modelling toolkit to science: Variational Bayesian Epistemology; iii) lay the foundation for a Variational Philosophy of Science as a suitable formal framework for the modeling, possibly the understanding, and ideally the fine-tuning, of the scientific enterprise as a whole. More generically, by suggesting a reconciliation between sophisticated humans' achievements (e.g., scientific theories and technologies) and standard cognitive phenomena (e.g., action and perception) through the existential imperatives highlighted by the FEP, with this thesis, I look for the establishment of a solid common ground between Philosophy of Science and Philosophy of Cognitive Sciences. The fruits of such a beneficial contamination, I believe, might not only take the form of ideas and theories able to thrive in the current cognitive milieu, but also catalyze into intelligently designed artificial agents and technologies that persist against the pretentious human selection and the inevitable erosion of time.},

This pattern was reversed under external threat. In Experiment 2, common identity reduced recognition of discrimination that was subtle, but not blatant. In addition, although a common-group identity did not facilitate Whites' willingness to protest blatant discrimination in Experiments 2 and 3, in Experiment 3 inducing a dual identity, which emphasizes both subgroup differences and a common-group representation, did. We discuss the implications of the results for when common- and dual-identity representations foster action on behalf of a minority group.},

This study examined how player--avatar connections may be better understood by integrating an existing parasocial approach (character attachment [CA]) with a social approach (player--avatar relationships [PARs]). A quantitative linguistic analysis of massively multiplayer online game (MMO) player interviews revealed statistically robust associations among language patterns, dimensions of CA, and PAR types. Validating and extending prior research, findings highlight the importance of selfdifferentiation and anthropomorphization in suspending disbelief so that the avatar may be taken as a fully social agent.},

It suggests that messages that are consistent with an individual's view, but formulated in an amplified, exaggerated, or even absurd manner, lead to an extended process of deliberative thinking and arouse lower levels of resistance compared to conventional persuasive approaches that use attitude-inconsistent messages. We argue that attitude-inconsistent messages are often automatically rejected among highly involved individuals with extreme views. The paradoxical thinking approach is intended to lead individuals to perceive their held societal beliefs or the current situation as farfetched and implausible, and ultimately, to lead to unfreezing and reevaluation of held attitudes. Eventually, unfreezing may lead to openness to alternative, more moderate viewpoints that may then be adopted. We introduce four variables that are part of the process (i.e., threat to identity, surprise, disagreement with the message, and unfreezing) and present empirical evidence supporting this conception with studies conducted mostly vis-{\`a}-vis conflict-supporting attitudes in the context of an intractable conflict.},

This interview with prominent social scientist Daniel Bar-Tal, Professor Emeritus, School of Education, Tel Aviv University, focused on the situation in Israel and Palestine following the Hamas attacks on October 7, 2023, and the subsequent war in Gaza. Interviews such as this are an academic inquiry drawing on the expert analysis of a scholar-activist, grounded in research and theory. As such an analysis, Bar-Tal explains the causes of this war, its context, its process, the contribution of each side to its escalation, and its effects on the possibilities of peaceful conflict resolution between Israeli Jews and Palestinians. He describes the current situation as governed by considerations of realpolitik, contestations over what defines antisemitism, and whether Israeli conduct in Gaza constitutes genocide or ethnic cleansing. This interview enables the application of Bar-Tal's systematic and holistic Theory of Intractable Conflict to the current crisis to interrogate how ethos of conflict, collective memory, and collective emotional orientation dynamically interconnect to form a culture of conflict.

  abstract = {Intractable intergroup conflicts require the formation of a conflictive ethos that enables a society to adapt to the conflict situation, survive the stressful period, and struggle successfully with the adversary. The formal termination of such a conflict begins with the elimination of the perceived incompatibility between the opposing parties through negotiation by their representatives---that is, a conflict resolution process. But this is only part of the long-term reconciliation process, which requires the formation of peaceful relations based on mutual trust and acceptance, cooperation, and consideration of mutual needs. The psychological aspect of reconciliation requires a change in the conflictive ethos, especially with respect to societal beliefs about group goals, about the adversary group, about the ingroup, about intergroup relations, and about the nature of peace. In essence, psychological reconciliation requires the formation of an ethos of peace, but this is extremely difficult in cases of intractable conflict. Political psychologists can and should work to improve the state of knowledge about reconciliation, which until now has received much less attention than conflict resolution.},

  abstract = {This essay explores the act of touching as it takes place in physical matter, in theorizing, and in the productive spaces where the two are indistinguishable. First, the author considers how feminist theory goes about touching science and unpacks touch as an act that reveals the self within the other and the other within the self. The essay then offers a tutorial in quantum field theory to prepare the reader for an unexpected interlocutor on the topic of touching: the electron. As Barad demonstrates with descriptions of electrons and how they have troubled physicists to the point of being ``normalized'' and called ``immoral,'' these particles resist normative notions of physical contact; they are perverse. On the human scale, electrons trouble the notion of touch by making it impossible to close the distance between atoms: the sense of touch paradoxically relies on electric repulsion between neighboring objects. On the subatomic scale, each electron gleans its energy from touching itself as if undergoing an exchange with another. Not only does the presence of contact come from its absence but also the presence of electrons themselves relies on a void holding their virtual counterparts. On every level, one can never reach the other---even the other within oneself. This paradox on the micro scale that constitutes all macro-scale matter calls into question the spatial and temporal fixity of identity. Barad shows that the notion of a unified, autonomous self is problematic not just on the personal level but on the particle level as well, and she responds to this deconstruction of matter with an ethics of response-ability.},

While ANT was originally rooted in Social Construction of Technology (SCOT) approaches, ANT has become a theoretical framework commonly used by scholars in numerous disciplines beyond STS, including Information Sciences. Although some scholars consider ANT to be now closer to sociomateriality studies, we claim that ANT differs from sociomateriality in that it suggests a different notion of power. In ANT, power results from actors' associations enacted into being rather than the sociomateriality claim that power results from existing power structures. We draw from our work on information technologies and social movements to illustrate this important distinction, and to show how ANT can be further strengthened by including the study of histories, memories and trajectories, in order to better understand power relations as associations enacted into being. In this way, we offer a deeper understanding of ANT and its utility for STS research in general, and information studies in particular.},

To do so, we conducted an extended replication of the classic social psychological shooter bias paradigm using robot stimuli to explore whether effects known from humanhuman intergroup experiments would generalize to robots that were racialized as Black and White. Reaction-time based measures revealed that participants demonstrated `shooter-bias' toward both Black people and robot racialized as Black. Participants were also willing to attribute a race to the robots depending on their racialization and demonstrated a high degree of inter-subject agreement when it came to these attributions.},

Although a human's ability to produce and interpret complex, dynamic facial expressions is seen as an important factor for human-human social interaction, it remains controversial in humanoid/android robotics, whether recreating such expressiveness is really worth the technical challenge, or not. In fact, one way to avoid the risk of giving rise to uncanny feelings in human observers is to follow an abstract design for humanoid robots. This question is also relevant in the context of mediated interaction using tele-operation technology, as soon as robotic embodiments are involved. Thus, this paper presents our current project, in which we are comparing the efficiency of transmitting nonverbal signals by means of ``Daryl'' featuring an abstract, mildly humanized design, against that of ``Geminoid F'', which features a highly anthropomorphic design. The ability of both of these robots to convey emotions by means of body movements has been successfully evaluated before, but using this ability to transmit nonverbal signals during remote conversation and comparing the resp. efficiencies has not yet been done.},

In both studies, people participated in a demonstration against right-wing populism using a virtual reality setting and were either stopped by the police in riot gear or by the police in regular uniforms. The results of Study 1 (N = 155) show that the police in riot gear were evaluated as more illegitimate compared to the police in normal clothing. The results of Study 2 (N = 97) replicated this finding and illustrated that police in riot gear (compared to regular uniforms) increased protestors' intentions to engage in direct resistance against the police. This effect was mediated by perceptions of illegitimacy and anger directed at the police. Furthermore, weakly identified protestors were particularly affected by the display of power and were more likely to engage in anti-police resistance and collective action. Implications are discussed.},

It is furthermore claimed that the methodological inspiration does not lead to any new insights and that these studies can hardly be differentiated from more traditional studies. This study supports this critique, arguing that the challenges of implementing discourse analysis in nursing research reflect a dominant pattern of thought in the discourse of the nursing profession that have held sway throughout the last century. We argue that this pattern of thought stems from the Western philosophy of consciousness and the conception of the sovereign subject. By applying a discourse analytical perspective to the discourse of the nursing profession itself, this study elucidates the challenges of applying discourse analysis in nursing research.},

Second Life users (N=279) completed an online questionnaire about their experiences of presence in the virtual world, the influence of their avatar on their offline appearance and health behaviors, and their level of satisfaction with the relationships they developed online. It was hypothesized that self-presence would be positively associated with avatar influence on health and appearance and that self-presence would render the influence of spatial and social presence statistically non-significant. Additionally, it was hypothesized that self-presence would be positively associated with satisfaction with relationships developed in the virtual world. Support was found for these predictions. Results suggest that self-presence is uniquely linked to the influence of the virtual self on offline health and appearance and is a significant predictor of the development of satisfying online relationships.

  abstract = {In this study, perceptions of security and civic services were measured among the Israeli-Arab minority youth. Three hundred participants completed a questionnaire assessing their propensity to enrol in security and civic services. Both types of national service were correlated with life satisfaction in Israel and three temporal attraction and repulsion factors that occurred in 2020--2021: the IDF assisting local municipalities during the COVID-19 pandemic, hostilities between Jews and Arabs in May 2021, and crime in Arab communities. A strong positive correlation was found between life satisfaction and willingness to engage in security and national service. The temporal factors did not mediate this correlation. Finally, the possibility of recruiting Arab minorities to security organizations is discussed.},

  abstract = {The effects of virtual cooperative video games have not yet been explored within the setting of hostile intergroup contexts; nor have they been tested among school-aged children. We present results from a longitudinal school-based intervention that enabled virtual contact between Jewish-Israeli and Palestinian-Israeli children. The program included six virtual and two face-to-face sessions. We find that relative to an intragroup contact control group, children who participated in the intergroup program showed reduced intergroup bias on both cognitive and emotional indicators, including reduced stereotypical views, negative emotions and discriminatory tendencies toward members of the other ethnic group, as well as increased willingness to engage in social contact with outgroup members. These effects were long lasting and preserved six months after termination of the program. The intervention's effectiveness was consistent across measures, gender, and ethnic groups. Thus, the program we developed offers a feasible, relatively cost-effective gaming intervention that can be applied even in areas characterized by severe ethnic tension and hostile conflict.},

This is motivated by an awareness of how cultural applications, in our case interactive performances, raise ethical issues that may challenge established research ethics processes. We review research ethics, HCI's engagement with ethics and the ethics of theatrical performance. Following an approach grounded in Responsible Research Innovation, we present the findings from a workshop in which artists, curators, commissioners, and researchers explored ethical challenges revealed by four case studies. We identify six ethical challenges for HCI's engagement with cultural applications: transgression, boundaries, consent, withdrawal, data, and integrity. We discuss two broader implications of these: managing tensions between multiple overlapping ethical frames; and the importance of managing ethical challenges during and after an experience as well as beforehand. Finally, we discuss how our findings extend previous discussions of Value Sensitive Design in HCI.},

Three hundred and twenty-two 3rd and 4th grade students from both Israeli--Jewish and Israeli--Palestinian schools in the ethnically mixed city of Jaffa were randomly assigned to either intervention or control classes. Members of the intervention classes engaged in ECEP's activities, whereas members of the control classes engaged in a social--emotional learning program. The program's outcomes were measured a week before, immediately after, and 15 months following termination. Results showed that the ECEP decreased stereotyping and discriminatory tendencies toward the other group and increased positive feelings and readiness for social contact with the other group upon program termination. Additionally, the effects of the ECEP were generalized to an ethnic group (i.e., Ethiopians) with whom the ECEP's participants did not have any contact. Finally, the ECEP retained its significant effect 15 months after the program's termination, despite the serious clashes between Israel and the Palestinians that occurred during that time. This empirical support for the ECEP'S utility in reducing prejudice makes it potentially applicable to other areas in the world, especially those that are characterized by ethnic tension and violent conflicts.},

Our results support this idea; a sample of players rated their character as having more favorable attributes that were more favorable than their own self-rated attributes. This trend was stronger among those with lower psychological well-being, who rated themselves comparatively lower than they rated their character. Our results suggest that the game world allows players the freedom to create successful virtual selves regardless of the constraints of their actual situation.},

These systems can be worn by users, carried around, and integrated in their everyday lives, thus enabling a more natural manner to deliver tactile cues. At the same time, the design of these types of devices presents new issues: the challenge is the correct identification of design guidelines, with the two-fold goal of minimizing system encumbrance and increasing the effectiveness and naturalness of stimulus delivery. Fabrics can represent a viable solution to tackle these issues. They are specifically thought ``to be worn'', and could be the key ingredient to develop wearable haptic interfaces conceived for a more natural HRI. In this paper, the author will review some examples of fabric-based WHS that can be applied to different body locations, and elicit different haptic perceptions for different application fields. Perspective and future developments of this approach will be discussed.},

In this article, I synthesise the research on fictional narrative interventions disseminated via media and present a model elucidating the pathways of influence on attitudes and behaviours related to intergroup conflict and reconciliation. The article identifies the different psychological mechanisms typically embedded in media-based narrative interventions, such as communication of social norms, role modelling of behaviours, perspective-taking, awareness-raising, and parasocial contact. I discuss how narrative interventions influence intergroup outcomes by shaping social interactions and discussions, and address heterogeneous effects by considering three sets of factors: (1) the combination of theoretical principles embedded in the intervention; (2) intervention design and implementation; and (3) the characteristics of the conflict context. Finally, I consider the benefits of narrative interventions over other forms of intergroup conflict interventions and highlight avenues for future research.},

  abstract = {Touch screens are a key component of consumer mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, as well as an increasingly common self-service component of information retrieval on fixed screens and mobile devices in-store. The ubiquity of touch screens in daily life increases consumer accessibility and extended use for shopping, whilst software innovations have increased the functionality of touch screens, for example the extent to which images respond to fingertip control. This study examines how users engage with interactive visual rotation and tactile simulation features while browsing fashion clothing products on touch screen devices and thus contributes to retail touch screen research that previously focused on in-store kiosks and window displays. Findings show that three dimensions of user engagement (endurability, novelty and felt involvement) are positively influenced by both forms of manipulation. In order to examine the extent to which touch screen user engagement varies with individual preferences for an in-store experience, the paper also examines whether user engagement outcomes are mediated by an individual's need for physical touch. Findings indicate that the need for touch does not explain the variance between individuals. We conclude that touch screen technology complements the physical retail environment.},

  abstract = {Robots have assumed increasingly complex duties since their initial conceptualization such as complex fabrication, navigation, and social tasks. Such an escalation of responsibility makes the assignment of robots to armed peacekeeping duties a possibility. However, allowing robots to keep the peace would require considerable human trust for success. A major difficulty in assessing the trust needed to form cooperative relationships between humans and robots is that self-reported trust of robots has been shown to vary across countries. This chapter presents findings from three experiments during which native and expatriate participants from China, Israel, Japan, and the United States indicated their trust of robotic peacekeepers that interrupted a virtual shopping task. We manipulated independent variables that included robot dialog structure (Experiment 1), the task orders driving robot behavior (Experiment 2), and the appearance and weapons wielded by the simulated robot (Experiment 3). Our results showed that dispositional (trait based) trust, obedience to robot demands, and self-reported (state based) trust of robots varied by culture. These findings extend prior investigations by measuring robot trust in the context of social obedience. Furthermore, they provide robot designers with valuable information about human perceptions of robot dialog, appearance, and behavior.},

This paper traces the "solutionism" critique to its origins in city planning and highlights the original concern with imaging and representation in the design process. It is increasingly cheap and easy to create compelling and seductive images of concept designs, which sell solutions and presume problems. We consider a range of strategies, which explicitly reject the search for "solutions". These include design fiction and critical design but also less well-known techniques, which aim for unuseless, questionable and silly designs. We present two examples of "magic machine" workshops where participants are encouraged to reject realistic premises for possible technological interventions and create absurd propositions from lo-fi materials. We argue that such practices may help researchers resist the impulse towards solutionism and suggest that attention to representation during the ideation process is a key strategy for this.},

In this article, we first review the recent developments on primary, secondary, and tertiary contact generalization. We then summarize mechanisms that underlie and condition each of these generalizations. Third, we highlight key critiques against the contact literature identifying avenues for future research on generalization processes.

With empathy, the experiential grounds upon which ethical and moral arguments are made require an essential transmissibility, and that which cannot be expressed in seemingly `universal' terms cannot be acknowledged. This article makes its arguments through a discussion of VR as an `empathy machine', and contextualizes empathy in digital media by suggesting it repeats not a psychological construct, but a concept derived from late 19th-century German aesthetic theory and its conceptualization of Einf{\"u}hlung. It proposes radical compassion as an alternative to empathy, and suggests that empathy is a limiting and problematic concept that effaces another's experience unless it can be made sensible.},

Exploratory studies have been performed at two rehabilitation centres to investigate the potential of our approach. The positive results of these studies pinpoint that our system endeavors promising opportunities to offer new forms of interventions for DD people.},

People may treat robots as mechanistic artifacts or may consider them to be intentional agents. This might result in explaining robots' behavior as stemming from operations of the mind (intentional interpretation) or as a result of mechanistic design (mechanistic interpretation). Here, we examined whether individual attitudes toward robots can be differentiated on the basis of default neural activity pattern during resting state, measured with electroencephalogram (EEG). Participants observed scenarios in which a humanoid robot was depicted performing various actions embedded in daily contexts. Before they were introduced to the task, we measured their resting state EEG activity. We found that resting state EEG beta activity differentiated people who were later inclined toward interpreting robot behaviors as either mechanistic or intentional. This pattern is similar to the pattern of activity in the default mode network, which was previously demonstrated to have a social role. In addition, gamma activity observed when participants were making decisions about a robot's behavior indicates a relationship between theory of mind and said attitudes. Thus, we provide evidence that individual biases toward treating robots as either intentional agents or mechanistic artifacts can be detected at the neural level, already in a resting state EEG signal.},

However, previous studies used restricted operationalizations of generalized prejudice that only assessed prejudice toward disadvantaged groups. In this paper, we explored a) whether Big Five trait-personality relationships observed under restricted operationalizations of generalized prejudice extend to an inclusive operationalization of generalized prejudice, and b) whether the relationship between personality and prejudice is moderated by certain group characteristics. Across four samples (N = 7,543), Openness was very weakly related to inclusive generalized prejudice, r = -.03, 95\%CI [-.07, -.001], whereas low Agreeableness was reliably associated with inclusive generalized prejudice (r = -.23, 95\%CI [-.31, -.16]). Several target characteristics moderated relationships between Big Five traits and prejudice; importantly, however, the relationship between Agreeableness and prejudice remained robust across target groups. These results provide new and more nuanced insights into the relationship between personality and prejudice.},

  abstract = {This present research explores a progressive repurposing of Virtual Reality technology, Virtual Immersive Contact (VIC), in a real-world setting to; explore viability to reduce prejudice and investigate the role of empathy in motivating prosocial behavior. The study employed a between-subjects repeated-measures experimental design of a randomized sample (n = 113) split into two conditions to reduce prejudice and discrimination in the active conflict area of the Central African Republic (CAR). In line with the study's hypotheses, VIC produced a significant increase in empathic concern for the Muslim outgroup and intentions to donate to a Muslim family, while also showing that the relationship between empathy and helping behaviours was mostly explained by confounding variables. This research provides both the first evidence of its kind that VIC could be a new form of fostering positive intergroup contact in an active conflict setting, crating a new facet of intergroup contact theory, and further evolving the literature on the empathy, prosocial behaviour relationship.},

In this reflexive commentary, we look back at some of the unspoken assumptions that informed how we wrote our 2006 paper. We connect some of these un-identified assumptions, and developments in the method over the years, with some conceptual mismatches and confusions we see in published TA studies. In order to facilitate better TA practice, we reflect on how our thinking has evolved -- and in some cases sedimented -- since the publication of our 2006 paper, and clarify and revise some of the ways we phrased or conceptualised TA, and the elements of, and processes around, a method we now prefer to call reflexive TA.},

Tele-operated robot avatars, in which an operator's behaviours are portrayed by a robot proxy, have the potential to improve distance interaction, e.g., improving social presence and trust. However, having communication mediated by a robot changes the perception of the operator's appearance and behaviour, which have been shown to be used alongside vocal cues in judging personality. In this paper we present a study that investigates how robot mediation affects the way the personality of the operator is perceived. More specifically, we aim to investigate if judges of personality can be consistent in assessing personality traits, can agree with one another, can agree with operators' self-assessed personality, and shift their perceptions to incorporate characteristics associated with the robot's appearance. Our experiments show that (i) judges utilise robot appearance cues along with operator vocal cues to make their judgements, (ii) operators' arm gestures reproduced on the robot aid personality judgements, and (iii) how personality cues are perceived and evaluated through speech, gesture and robot appearance is highly operator-dependent. We discuss the implications of these results for both tele-operated and autonomous robots that aim to portray personality.},

  abstract = {Humanoid robot avatars are a potential new telecommunication tool, whereby a user is remotely represented by a robot that replicates their arm, head, and possible face movements. They have been shown to have a number of benefits over more traditional media such as phones or video calls. However, using a teleoperated humanoid as a communication medium inherently changes the appearance of the operator, and appearance-based stereotypes are used in interpersonal judgments (whether consciously or unconsciously). One such judgment that plays a key role in how people interact is personality. Hence, we have been motivated to investigate if and how using a robot avatar alters the perceived personality of teleoperators. To do so, we carried out two studies where participants performed 3 communication tasks, solo in study one and dyadic in study two, and were recorded on video both with and without robot mediation. Judges recruited using online crowdsourcing services then made personality judgments of the participants in the video clips. We observed that judges were able to make internally consistent trait judgments in both communication conditions. However, judge agreement was affected by robot mediation, although which traits were affected was highly task dependent. Our most important finding was that in dyadic tasks personality trait perception was shifted to incorporate cues relating to the robot's appearance when it was used to communicate. Our findings have important implications for telepresence robot design and personality expression in autonomous robots.},

Several conference panels and journal issues have focused on the contributions feminism, gender theory, and queer theory can make to HCI. This paper discusses the key developments in the sub-field of Gender HCI over the past five years. We discuss, in particular, how recent approaches to gender in HCI move past questions of how men and women interact differently with technologies. Scholars are focusing on activist, intersectional, and reflexive approaches to gender and identity in design that focus on inclusion and accountability in terms of who technologies are designed for and in what ways. This scholarship draws on a wide variety of theoretical approaches to gender not integrated or well-known in the general literature or education in HCI or computing. We recommend the implementation of a Gender 101 general education module for all computing students to provide fluency in gender theory as a way to promote discussion, inclusivity, and accountability in interaction design and computing practices and organizations.},

This article reviews the literature about human responses to healthcare robots and summarises the variables that have been found to influence responses. It may be possible to increase acceptance of healthcare robots by properly assessing the needs of the human user and then matching the robot's role, appearance and behaviour to these needs. Because robots have limitations in their abilities, another way to increase acceptance may be to modify the expectations of users to better match robots' abilities. More research needs to investigate potential users' needs and expectations in specific situations and whether interventions to increase the match between robot and human can increase acceptance.},

During the Israel Palestine conflict, the primary form of movement restriction that has been documented is closure to day migrant workers of the borders between Israel and the West Bank and Gaza Strip. In recent years, however, restrictions on movement throughout the West Bank have been applied to the general Palestinian population. International accompaniment work has endeavoured to resist such restrictions and to escape the limitations of traditional human rights documentation. In doing so, it presents alternative views: of the population as more than `worker'; and the impact of restrictions on both the individual and the collective. It also demonstrates the material, emotional and cultural aspects of movement. Observation emerges as a principal form of resistance. This suggests that restrictions can be seen as discipline in Foucault's sense. The West Bank experience, however, is better characterized by a negative rather than the positive conception of discipline associated with the productive control of labour.},

As an example of post-Kantian philosophy, Serres critiques the classical logic of identity as based on a `third man' argument. This third space -- personified as the parasite -- is essential to thinking communication and transformation in systems. Parasitism operates through the logic of taking without giving or `abuse value'. But the parasite nevertheless makes exchange possible by creating connections between otherwise incommensurable forms of ordering. Human relations oscillate through period of disequilibrium, often involving scapegoating and exclusion, as parasitic cascades emerge. However, parasites in the form of jokers and quasi-objects create powerful mechanisms for creating collectivity and individuality. The `dark organizational theory' of Serres allows for adequate descriptions of these processes.},

According to the dominant narrative in the literature on the ``attention economy,'' a user's lack of attention is due to the large amounts of information available in their everyday environments. I will argue that information-abundance fails to account for some of the central manifestations of distraction, such as sudden urges to check a particular information-source in the absence of perceptual information. I will use active inference, and in particular models of action selection based on the minimization of expected free energy, to develop an alternative answer to the question about what makes it difficult to attend. Besides obvious adversarial forms of inference, in which algorithms build up models of users in order to keep them scrolling, I will show that active inference provides the tools to identify a number of problematic structural features of current digital technologies: they contain limitless sources of novelty, they can be navigated by very simple and effortless motor movements, and they offer their action possibilities everywhere and anytime independent of place or context. Moreover, recent models of motivated control show an intricate interplay between motivation and control that can explain sudden transitions in motivational state and the consequent alteration of the salience of actions. I conclude, therefore, that the challenges users encounter when engaging with digital technologies are less about information overload or inviting content, but more about the continuous availability of easily available possibilities for action.},

We outline a best practices-based framework to foster community-based, collaborative art such as cocreated community murals. Specifically, we identify a strategic and successive process for collaborative art initiatives by integrating the academic literature on art, aesthetics, community, and consumer research together with the practices of arts organizations working to transform communities through participatory, cocreated art. The article highlights the contributions of this work to academic research, public policy, and community organizing efforts and outlines questions to encourage more researchers and practitioners to investigate the dynamics of collaborative art to transform communities.},

While social presence seemed to affect the satisfaction most, place and co-presence also affected students' satisfaction in the virtual world. Moreover, immersive tendencies of the students were related to their place and co-presence but not to their social presence. Findings highlighted the important issues for the design of virtual world environments to increase presence and satisfaction of students.},

  abstract = {Interaction patterns of reciprocity and compensation have received extensive consideration in the literature on mutual influence processes. Unfortunately, conflicting and ambiguous definitions of these concepts, along with inadequate differentiation from other patterns such as matching, convergence, divergence, and complementarity have hindered theoretical and empirical progress. This article is dedicated to sorting out the differences among the various accommodation processes and offering appropriate constitutive definitions and operationalizations. It is proposed that definitions of reciprocity and compensation be distinguished from matching and complementarity in that the former incorporate principles of(1) directedness, (2) contingency, (3) both unidirectional and mutual influence, (4) change rather than maintenance, (5) directionality rather than magnitude of change, (6) intentional and automatic processes, and (7) functional equivalence of behaviors. Operationally, these criteria imply a focus on designs demonstrating causality or strong association between partner behaviors, concatenous and lagged responses, within-dyad and longitudinal analyses, and, for many purposes, a more molar perspective. Issues of macro versus micro measurement, perceived versus actual reciprocity and compensation, and reliance on observer versus participant perspectives are also considered.},

Teletherapy became the primary means of service delivery for many who had never or only sparingly used it. The Family Institute at Northwestern University, in response to encouraging findings with respect to the effectiveness of teletherapy and recognizing advantages with respect to access to care, launched our teletherapy services in 2018. As a relationship-based organization, we were keen to exploit the opportunity that teletherapy provides to integrate additional members of the client system into the treatment. Over these two plus years, we have learned a great deal. Our learning was greatly accelerated by our transition to a 100\% teletherapy practice in the wake of the pandemic. Teletherapy is a different context. Intentionally managing the context's constraints and exploiting its strengths is key to providing high-quality couple and family therapy. This step is often overlooked or resisted when teletherapy is an occasional add-on to a face-to-face practice.},

  abstract = {This chapter interrogates the political stakes of dialogue in processes of co-design. The chapter first reviews how citizen participation has been challenged from political theorists on the ``agonist'' end of realism, and from critics that dismiss such processes as ``post-political'' choreographies of neoliberal governance. Discussing the case of a citizen dialogue in the context of urban design in Gothenburg, the chapter introduces actor-network theory as an alternative account of how post-political effects may result from participatory design processes. This theoretical shift implies shifting the focus from ideology critique to a close examination of the material modes of co-design. The chapter argues that the notion of betrayal is key to post-political effects of participation. Thus, the concept is used on two levels of abstraction: First, there is a sense in which citizens' and co-designers' interests are betrayed in the process of co-design, partly as a result of the fact that policy-making invariably involves the reduction of dissensus, and the construction of a consensus. Second, borrowing from the ontology of actor-network theory and its notion of translation, the chapter argues that the representation of citizens' ideas for co-design inevitably -- like any other representation -- involves a betrayal of the entity that is being represented.},

Despite the many devoted efforts and the multiple advances in related areas, these devices have not become mainstream yet. Nevertheless, during recent years, new devices with improved features have appeared, being used for research purposes too. This paper provides a review of current commercial smart gloves focusing on three main capabilities: (i) hand and finger pose estimation and motion tracking, (ii) kinesthetic feedback, and (iii) tactile feedback. For the first capability, a detailed reference model of the hand and finger basic movements (known as degrees of freedom) is proposed. Based on the PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews for the period 2015--2021, 24 commercial smart gloves have been identified, while many others have been discarded because they did not meet the inclusion criteria: currently active commercial and fully portable smart gloves providing some of the three main capabilities for the whole hand. The paper reviews the technologies involved, main applications and it discusses about the current state of development. Reference models to support end users and researchers comparing and selecting the most appropriate devices are identified as a key need.},

Study 2 (N= 244 White South African students) predicted whether social identity would positively predict collective action benefiting the ingroup, and intergroup contact would positively predict support for policies to benefit the Black outgroup. Both studies yielded evidence in support of the predictive power of social identity and contact on collective action and policy support. Additionally, Study 1 confirmed that intergroup contact moderated the effects of social identity on relative deprivation, and relative deprivation on collective action. Overall findings support an integration of SIMCA and intergroup contact theory, and provide a fuller understanding of the social psychological processes leading to collective action.},

This work presents new insights and methods for combining heterogeneous fabric material layers to create soft fabric-based actuators. This work demonstrates that a range of multi-degree-of-freedom motions can be generated by varying fabrics and their layered arrangements when a thin airtight bladder is inserted between them and inflated. Specifically, we present bending and straightening fabric-based actuators that are simple to manufacture, lightweight, require low operating pressures, display a high torque-to-weight ratio, and occupy a low volume in their unpressurized state. Their utility is demonstrated through their integration into a glove that actively assists hand opening and closing.},

  abstract = {We introduce Intermediated Reality (IR), a framework for intermediated communication enabling collaboration through remote possession of entities (e.g. toys) that come to life in mobile Mediated Reality (MR). As part of a two-way conversation demonstration, each person communicates through a toy figurine that is remotely located in front of the other participant. Each person's face is tracked through the front camera of their mobile devices and the tracking pose information is transmitted to the remote participant's device along with the synchronized captured voice audio, allowing a turn-based interactive avatar chat session, which we have called ToyMeet. By altering the camera video feed with a reconstructed appearance of the object in a deformed pose, we perform the illusion of movement in real-world objects to realize collaborative tele-present augmented reality (AR). In this turn based interaction, each participant first sees their own captured puppetry message locally with their device's front facing camera. Next, they receive a view of their counterpart's captured response locally (in AR) with seamless visual deformation of their local 3D toy seen through their device's rear facing camera. We detail optimization of the animation transmission and switching between devices with minimized latency for coherent smooth chat interaction. An evaluation of rendering performance and system latency is included. As an additional demonstration of our framework, we generate facial animation frames for 3D printed stop motion in collaborative mixed reality. This allows a reduction in printing costs since the in-between frames of key poses can be generated digitally with shared remote review.},

Yet since then, support is waning and in both populations the belief that a lasting peace would arise from peace negotiations is much lower at 35\%. Distinct cohort effects exist with the 1990s birth cohort in Palestine (Israel) having up to 15\% (15\%) lower support for peace negotiations and 20\% (10\%) lower belief that they will lead to lasting peace, compared to the 1980s cohort at the same age. While we cannot claim causality, the 90s cohort effect is associated with their unique experience of violence and political turmoil in their younger years (the Second Intifada, two Gaza wars, the Lebanon war, the breakdown of negotiations in Sharm el-Sheikh), in line with empirical literature on the persistent effect of violence experienced as a young person on attitudes, beliefs and behaviour as an adult. Younger cohorts' experiences will be an important determinant of overall support for peace in the future and the prospects for peace in the region.},

This approach is motivated by the difficulty of obtaining an accurate estimate through existing algorithms that use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) draws, where the draws are typically costly to obtain and highly correlated in high-dimensional settings. In contrast, we use the cross-entropy (CE) method, a versatile adaptive Monte Carlo algorithm originally developed for rare-event simulation. The main advantage of the importance sampling approach is that random samples can be obtained from some convenient density with little additional costs. As we are generating independent draws instead of correlated MCMC draws, the increase in simulation effort is much smaller should one wish to reduce the numerical standard error of the estimator. Moreover, the importance density derived via the CE method is grounded in information theory, and therefore, is in a well-defined sense optimal. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed approach by two empirical applications involving women's labor market participation and U.S. macroeconomic time series. In both applications, the proposed CE method compares favorably to existing estimators.},

Unfortunately current methods generally do not scale well beyond the small tabular setting due to the need for an inner-loop MDP solver, and even non-Bayesian methods that do themselves scale often require extensive interaction with the environment to perform well, being inappropriate for high stakes or costly applications such as healthcare. In this paper we introduce our method, Approximate Variational Reward Imitation Learning (AVRIL), that addresses both of these issues by jointly learning an approximate posterior distribution over the reward that scales to arbitrarily complicated state spaces alongside an appropriate policy in a completely offline manner through a variational approach to said latent reward. Applying our method to real medical data alongside classic control simulations, we demonstrate Bayesian reward inference in environments beyond the scope of current methods, as well as task performance competitive with focused offline imitation learning algorithms.},

However, the information-seeking process can be exhausting, cumbersome and even confusing for migrants as they must cope with time-consuming information overload while searching desired information from lists of documents. Chatbots are easy-to-use, natural, and intuitive, and thus could support information-seeking. There is a lack of research that engages and empowers migrants and other stakeholders as co-design participants in chatbot development. We explored how migrants can be empowered in designing a chatbot that supports their social integration. Using a co-design approach, we conducted a series of activities with migrants and other stakeholders (i.e., online questionnaires, empathy probes, surveys, and co-design workshops) to first understand their expectations regarding chatbots, and then co-design a personality-driven chatbot. We found that chatbot personality can drive co-designing a chatbot as design goals, design directions, and design criteria.},

One such solution is virtual reality (VR). This critical review examines VR as a promising new media tool to reduce prejudice and improve intergroup relations. Unlike traditional prejudice reduction strategies, VR provides researchers with a high degree of experimental control and flexibility. However, VR prejudice reduction research is in its infancy, and a myriad of challenges have emerged, including the: i) difficulty of cross-study comparisons and navigation of existing literature due to lack of standardized VR methodologies; ii) limitations of adapting traditional prejudice reduction strategies into VR; and iii) the lack of measurement of behaviors. This paper critically evaluates each of these limitations and, in doing so, proposes a new working framework incorporating two dimensions, the: i) VR input device, and ii) level of interactivity and mobility in the VR environment. This framework attempts to address the lack of standardization of immersion and presence in current VR research by helping guide future VR researchers to better identify the type of research they are conducting, evaluate existing research findings, and thus make cross-comparisons in VR prejudice reduction findings more meaningful.},

Robotic telepresence system is a newer variant of a telepresence system. Even though robot characteristics of having physical embodiment could be effective on building presence of itself, this could yield distortion of presence of a remote sender in telepresence. Thus, in order to determine effective methods of increasing sender presence during telecommunication, we perform a two within-participants experiment, considering the effects of the embodiment levels, by comparing a weakly-embodied telepresence system, a tablet and a strongly-embodied telepresence system, a telepresence robot (number of participants, N = 48). In this study, the participants engage in conversations with a remote sender either through a tablet or a telepresence robot. The results show that participants have a lesser sense of sender presence for a strongly-embodied telepresence system compared to the weakly-embodied telepresence system. On the other hand, participants perceived more presence of a telepresence system toward a strongly-embodied telepresence system than a weakly-embodied telepresence system. The implications of these findings are the weakly-embodied telepresence systems would be effectively used in settings where emotional connection is a priority. In addition, incorporating sensory modalities should be considered for neutralizing the negative effects of strong embodiment on presence.},

Even though certain characteristics of robots such as identity could be effective at generating a sense of presence, this risks yielding a distortion of presence in the remote sender. Thus, in order to find effective ways to increase presence, we executed an experiment comparing a telepresence robot with high identity and a telepresence robot with low identity. The 60 participants in this study engaged in a video call with a remote sender using either a telepresence robot with high identity or a telepresence robot with low identity. The results showed that participants felt more remote sender presence when interacting with the telepresence robot with low identity than they did with the one with high identity. On the other hand, when a telepresence robot has high identity, participants felt more presence toward the robot than they did toward the one with low identity. In the second study (N = 72), participants experienced two types of telepresence robots (identity level: a telepresence robot with high identity vs. a telepresence robot with low identity) with two types of remote senders (number of remote senders: single remote sender vs. multiple remote senders). The identity level of the robot and the number of remote senders affected the presence of the remote sender, telepresence, and the presence of the robot. We discuss in detail the implications for the design of telepresence robots in terms of increasing presence.},

  abstract = {Silverstone's `proper distance' is one of the most original and productive conceptualizations of a fundamental problem in the ethics of mediation: the humanization of vulnerable others. This is because `proper distance' is not only a normative but also, importantly, an analytical concept. Whereas in its normative dimension, proper distance refers to the degree of proximity required for mediated relationships of care and responsibility to develop, in its analytical dimension, the metaphorical vocabulary of space becomes an important resource in evaluating how mediation produces `humanity' through the positioning of mediated others along the axis of proximity--distance. My application of this analytical vocabulary to the mediation of humanitarianism enables me to create a typology of paradigms of solidarity, namely `pity', `irony' and `agonism', highlighting the different ways in which their particular articulations of proximity--distance produce distinct conceptions of `humanity' and, therefore, distinct proposals for solidarity towards vulnerable others. Focusing, specifically, on the critique of an emerging paradigm of solidarity as irony, I argue that, even though it appears as a promising response to pity and its misleading spatiality of universal proximity, irony celebrates consumerism as a reflexive distance-from-the self and is, therefore, unable to put forward a morally acceptable proposal of solidarity.},

  abstract = {We assessed evidence for a contextual effect of positive intergroup contact, whereby the effect of intergroup contact between social contexts (the between-level effect) on outgroup prejudice is greater than the effect of individual-level contact within contexts (the within-level effect). Across seven large-scale surveys (five cross-sectional and two longitudinal), using multilevel analyses, we found a reliable contextual effect. This effect was found in multiple countries, operationalizing context at multiple levels (regions, districts, and neighborhoods), and with and without controlling for a range of demographic and context variables. In four studies (three cross-sectional and one longitudinal) we showed that the association between context-level contact and prejudice was largely mediated by more tolerant norms. In social contexts where positive contact with outgroups was more commonplace, norms supported such positive interactions between members of different groups. Thus, positive contact reduces prejudice on a macrolevel, whereby people are influenced by the behavior of others in their social context, not merely on a microscale, via individuals' direct experience of positive contact with outgroup members. These findings reinforce the view that contact has a significant role to play in prejudice reduction, and has great policy potential as a means to improve intergroup relations, because it can simultaneously impact large numbers of people.},

While several groups have begun designing devices, there are few devices that have progressed enough to provide clinical evidence of their design's therapeutic abilities.

We define our orientations as decolonising in, by and through PD praxis when working on issues of land-based conflict. We argue these multiplicitous orientations allow for negotiations between political struggle and indigenous connection to the land, how INGOs embody conflicting justice agendas and how equity enriches yet complicates community sustainment.

This review considers a new approach based on existing theories of functional brain organisation. The free energy principle (a.k.a. active inference), and its instantiation in the Bayesian brain, offers a complete and simple formulation of mood. It has been proposed that emotions reflect the precision of -- or certainty about -- the predicted sensorimotor/interoceptive consequences of action. By extending this reasoning, in a hierarchical setting, we suggest mood states act as (hyper) priors over uncertainty (i.e. emotions). Here, we consider the same computational pathology in the proprioceptive and interoceptive (behavioural and autonomic) domain in order to furnish an explanation for mood disorders. This formulation reconciles several strands of research at multiple levels of enquiry.},

We aimed to identify whether, when, and why contact has mobilizing effects (promoting collective action) or sedative effects (inhibiting collective action). For both moderators and mediators, factors associated with the intergroup situation (compared with those associated with the out-group or the in-group) emerged as the most important. Group status had important effects. For members of socially advantaged groups (examined in 98 studies, 100 samples), contact had a general mobilizing effect, which was stronger when contact increased awareness of experiences of injustice among members of disadvantaged groups. For members of disadvantaged groups (examined in 49 studies, 58 samples), contact had mixed effects. Contact that increased awareness of injustice mobilized collection action; contact that made the legitimacy of group hierarchy or threat of retaliation more salient produced sedative effects. Public Abstract We present a review of existing studies that have investigated the relationship between intergroup contact and collective action aimed at promoting equity for disadvantaged groups. We further consider the influence of contact that is positive or negative and face-to-face or indirect (e.g., through mass or social media), and we distinguish between collective action that involves socially acceptable behaviors or is destructive and violent. We identified 134 studies, considering both advantaged (100 samples) and disadvantaged groups (58 samples). We found that intergroup contact impacts collective action differently depending on group status. Contact generally leads advantaged groups to mobilize in favor of disadvantaged groups. However, contact has variable effects on members of disadvantaged groups: It sometimes promotes their collective action in support of their own group; in other cases, it leads them to be less likely to engage in such action. We examine when and why contact can have these different effects.},

English speakers tend to assume that English transcends culture, perfectly capturing objective features of the external world. Comparison of the conflict resolution vocabularies of English, Arabic, and Hebrew demonstrates that themodel of conflict resolution implicit in English terminology is merely one possible version. The three languages vary significantly in their built-in assumptions about the nature of conflict, objectives of conflict resolution, and anticipation of what the termination of conflict entails. Such conceptual antinomies may hinder conflict resolution by impeding communication and frustrating the synchronization of negotiating moves. Nonnative speakers tend to speak in English but think in the mother tongue. Moreover, frontal negotiation is simply the point of contact among delegations whose consultation, decision making, drafting, and political processes are conducted in the native language. Israeli-Syrian negotiations since 1991 exemplify some dissonant expectations about conflict resolution across Hebrew and Arabic.},

These visuals often rely on embodied interaction techniques, such as motion capture or biosignal sensors. However, there is a lack of research into how audience members experience these interactive visuals, and how to enhance that experience. We conducted an audience study, involving four different dance performances. Each of the performances explored a different approach for interaction involving visuals. We collected data from audience members, regarding their experience of the performances, using questionnaires and interviews. The analysis of this data allows us to identify implications for design: balancing trade-offs within a mapping clarity spectrum; connecting layers; visuals as co-creative mediator; defined territory and individuality of visuals; exploration of perspective shift and abstract fragmentation. We argue that these considerations are relevant for designers of systems visualizing embodied interaction, not just for dance, but also for other related applications.},

One goal in soft robotics is to endow robots with new, bioinspired features that permit morphologically adaptive interactions with unpredictable environments. Here, we review three key elements of bioinspired soft robots from a mechanics vantage point, namely, materials selection, actuation, and design. Soft materials are necessary for safe interaction and overall actuation of bioinspired robots. The intrinsic properties of materials in soft robots allow for an ``embodied intelligence'' that can potentially reduce the mechanical and algorithmic complexity in ways not possible with rigidbodied robots Finally, soft robotics can be combined with tissue engineering and synthetic biology to create bio-hybrid systems with unique sensing, dynamic response, and mobility. Bioinspired soft robots have the ability to also expedite the evolution of co-robots that can safely interact with humans.},

  abstract = {Meta-analyses show that low levels of Openness and Agreeableness correlate with generalized prejudice. However, previous studies narrowly assessed prejudice toward low-status, disadvantaged groups. Using a broad operationalization of generalized prejudice toward a heterogeneous array of targets, we sought to answer two questions: (a) Are some types of people prejudiced against most types of groups? and (b) Are some types of people prejudiced against certain types of groups? Across four samples (N = 7,543), Openness was very weakly related to broad generalized prejudice, r = -.03, 95\% confidence interval (CI) [-.07, -.001], whereas low Agreeableness was reliably associated with broad generalized prejudice, r = -.23, 95\% CI [-.31, -.16]. When target characteristics moderated relationships between Big Five traits and prejudice, they implied that perceiver--target dissimilarity on personality traits explains prejudice. Importantly, the relationship between Agreeableness and prejudice remained robust across target groups, suggesting it is the personality trait orienting people toward (dis)liking of others.},

The authors track recent trends in contact theory to the emergence of extended, or indirect, forms of contact. These advances lead to an intriguing proposition: that simply imagining intergroup interactions can produce more positive perceptions of outgroups. The authors discuss empirical research supporting the imagined contact proposition and find it to be an approach that is at once deceptively simple and remarkably effective. Encouraging people to mentally simulate a positive intergroup encounter leads to improved outgroup attitudes and reduced stereotyping. It curtails intergroup anxiety and extends the attribution of perceivers' positive traits to others. The authors describe the advantages and disadvantages of imagined contact compared to conventional strategies, outline an agenda for future research, and discuss applications for policymakers and educators in their efforts to encourage more positive intergroup relations.},

Working with complex socio-political realities presents significant challenges for HCI researchers, which are amplified by the current democratic and economic crisis. In this article, we present insights from a longitudinal study where we worked with multiple stakeholders in the context of an austerity-driven transformation of public parks service in a city in the North East of England. Over the course of 20 months, we developed a participatory socio-technical process designed to create collaborative spaces between communities and institutions to re-envision and re-shape the city's public parks service. The study contributes to HCI research concerned with developing tools and processes that aim at connecting across the boundaries between communities and institutions. Our process and the resulting analysis expose the practical complexities of transformation and co-creation processes and the troubles that come with opening spaces for wider participation within highly contested and political settings. We provide an orientation for HCI design research aspiring to contribute to social innovation and democratic practices in troubled times.},

Concentration on socially useful products offers promise of a set of indicators that could be applied across domains: These include diagnosis, generation, germinality, and similar properties. Such indicators can be recognized with a substantial level of agreement by different observers, and can be used to judge both amount and kind of creativity. A universal aesthetic would offer perspectives on assessment of creativity, but would also improve communication among creative individuals and people such as critics, sponsors, clients, and the general public, as well as suggesting guidelines for teaching and learning activities and for better understanding of how to deal with misuse of creativity.},

The first stage of investigation involves confirmatory factor analyses and invariance tests on the measurement scales used. The results of the proposed regression models indicate that demographic variables have the highest predictive capacity in the two countries. Attitudes toward technology also demonstrate some predictive ability, while cultural values have a negligible direct impact on technology use. The results of structural equation models indicate that cultural values have a fundamental indirect impact on the use of technology-based services, and such effect is mediated by attitudes toward technology.},

However, the capacities of the health systems to address it were not equal, with Israel more equipped for the outbreak with infrastructure, resources, manpower and later, vaccines. The pandemic demonstrated the life-saving benefits of cooperation and the self-defeating harms brought by non-cooperation. These trends are explored here by an international team of public health and environmental scholars, including those from different sides of the Israeli--Palestinian conflict. This article explores the importance of recognizing the Israeli and Palestinian jurisdictions as a single epidemiological unit, and illustrates how doing so is a pragmatic positioning that can serve self-interest. We demonstrate how despite political shocks precipitating non-cooperation, there has been a recurrent tendency towards limited cooperation. The paper concludes with lessons over the need for reframing public health as a potential bridge, the need for structural changes creating sustainable platforms for accelerated transboundary cooperation to enable the steady management of current and future public and environmental health crises regardless of dynamic political crises, and the importance of civil society and international organizations in forging collaboration in advance of governmental engagement.},

Alfred Jarry's posthumous novel, Exploits and Opinions of Dr. Faustroll, Pataphysician, first appeared in 1911, and over the next 100 years, his pataphysical supersession of metaphysics would influence everyone from Marcel Duchamp and Boris Vian to Umberto Eco and Jean Baudrillard. In 1948 in Paris, a group of writers and thinkers would found the College of 'Pataphysics, still going strong today. The iconoclastic Ren{\'e} Daumal was the first to elaborate upon Jarry's unique and humorous philosophy. Though Daumal is better known for his unfinished novel Mount Analogue and his refusal to be adopted by the Surrealist movement, this newly translated volume of writings offers a glimpse of often overlooked Daumal: Daumal the pataphysician. Pataphysical Essays collects Daumal's overtly pataphysical writings from 1929 to 1941, from his landmark exposition on pataphysics and laughter to his late essay, "The Pataphysics of Ghosts." Daumal's "Treatise on Patagrams" offers the reader everything from a recipe for the disintegration of a photographer to instructions on how to drill a fount of knowledge in a public urinal. This volume also includes Daumal's column for the Nouvelle Revue Fran{\c c}aise, "Pataphysics This Month." Reading like a deranged encyclopedia, "Pataphysics This Month" describes a new mythology for the field of science, and amply demonstrates that the twentieth century had been a distinctly pataphysical era},

In this paper we first discuss in more detail varieties of interactions where one child, or two children simultaneously, play with a robot. We then outline a new research direction in the project which studies how a mobile robot can adapt t o individual children. Quantitative examples of activity levels in child-robot interactions are included. The paper concludes by outlining future research directions for adaptive robots in autism therapy.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Disruptions in the ordinary sense of selfhood underpin both pathological and ``enlightened'' states of consciousness. People suffering from depersonalization can experience the loss of a sense of self as devastating, often accompanied by intense feelings of alienation, fear, and hopelessness. However, for meditative contemplatives from various traditions, ``selfless'' experiences are highly sought after, being associated with enduring peace and joy. Little is understood about how these contrasting dysphoric and euphoric experiences should be conceptualized. In this paper, we propose a unified account of these selfless experiences within the active inference framework. Building on our recent active inference research, we propose an account of the experiences of selfhood as emerging from a temporally deep generative model. We go on to develop a view of the self as playing a central role in structuring ordinary experience by ``tuning'' agents to the counterfactually rich possibilities for action. Finally, we explore how depersonalization may result from an inferred loss of allostatic control and contrast this phenomenology with selfless experiences reported by meditation practitioners. We will show how, by beginning with a conception of self-modeling within an active inference framework, we have available to us a new way of conceptualizing the striking experiential similarities and important differences between these selfless experiences within a unifying theoretical framework. We will explore the implications for understanding and treating dissociative disorders, as well as elucidate both the therapeutic potential, and possible dangers, of meditation.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Many independent studies in social robotics and human--robot interaction have gained knowledge on various factors that affect people's perceptions of and behaviors toward robots. However, only a few of those studies aimed to develop models of social robot acceptance integrating a wider range of such factors. With the rise of robotic technologies for everyday environments, such comprehensive research on relevant acceptance factors is increasingly necessary. This article presents a conceptual model of social robot acceptance with a strong theoretical base, which has been tested among the general Dutch population (n = 1,168) using structural equation modeling. The results show a strong role of normative believes that both directly and indirectly affect the anticipated acceptance of social robots for domestic purposes. Moreover, the data show that, at least at this stage of diffusion within society, people seem somewhat reluctant to accept social behaviors from robots. The current findings of our study and their implications serve to push the field of acceptable social robotics forward. For the societal acceptance of social robots, it is vital to include the opinions of future users at an early stage of development. This way future designs can be better adapted to the preferences of potential users.},

The paper presents a multimodal approach to end-of-speaker-turn prediction using sequential probabilistic models (Conditional Random Fields) to learn a model from observations of real-life multi-party meetings. Although the results are not as good as expected, we provide insight into which modalities are important when taking a multimodal approach to the problem based on literature and our own results.},

In urban regeneration projects, it fosters engagement by the community and integration among different forms of city urbanization, such as formal and informal areas, i.e. slums. Despite the potentialities of participatory processes, usually the plurality of actors involved challenges in the development of projects. From this perspective, one of the most critical issues is the articulation of their actions in terms of time. Actually, the difference in background, role and motivation between the participating actors can result in temporal misfits that hinder the implementation of actions. Thus, this paper explores the temporal dimension of community-based participatory design projects. Through action research, undertaken in a Brazilian context, we found out three different types of temporal misfits that can occur in this kind of project. Reflecting on them using concepts from project management and participatory design theory, we identified four contextual time factors that have to be considered to deal with timing challenges and to strengthen this practice.},

Two experiments were conducted using the ``minimal group paradigm'' to explore whether social identity theory influences trust formation and impressions of a robot. In Experiment 1, participants were allocated to either a ``robot'' or ``computer'' group, and then they played a cooperative visual tracking game with an Aldebaran Nao humanoid robot as a partner. We hypothesised participants in the ``robot group'' would demonstrate intergroup bias by sitting closer to the robot (proxemics) and trusting the robot's suggested answers more frequently than their ``computer group'' counterparts. Experiment 2 used an almost identical procedure with a different set of participants; however, all participants were assigned to the ``robot group'' and thee different levels of anthropomorphic robot movement were manipulated. Our results suggest that intergroup bias and humanlike movement can significantly affect human-robot approach behaviour. Significant effects were found for trusting the robot's suggested answers with respect to task difficulty, but not for group membership or robot movement.},

This class consists of robots that are not only capable of engaging in social interaction with humans, but are using primarily their social capabilities to perform their desired functions. Socially interactive robots provide entertainment, information, and/or assistance; this last category is typically encompassed by socially assistive robotics. In all cases, such robots can achieve their primary functions without performing functional physical work.},

For this purpose, we created a set of virtual scenarios in which the confederate's ethnicity (white vs. black) and appearance (business man vs. beggar, with casual dress as a control condition) were crossed. The study aimed to explore how the emotional reactions of participants changed according to the confederate's status signals as well as signals that they belong to the same or a different ethnic group. Participants' alertness, calmness, and engagement were monitored using electroencephalogram (EEG) during the original virtual reality (VR) video sessions. Participants' distress and empathy when exposed to helping interactions were self-assessed after the VR video sessions. The results pointed out that, irrespective of whether they helped the confederate or were helped by him/her, white participants showed higher levels of alertness when exposed to helping interactions involving a white beggar or a black businessman, and their emotional calmness and engagement were higher when interacting with a black beggar or a white businessman. The results for self-assessed distress and empathy followed the same tendency, indicating how physiological and self-assessed measures can both contribute to a better understanding of the emotional processes in virtual intergroup helping situations. Based on the presented results, the methodological and practical implications of VR in terms of enhancing self-reflective capacities in intergroup helping processes are discussed.},

Interventions encouraging disadvantaged-group members to like advantaged-group members may also prompt the disadvantaged to underestimate the injustice suffered by their group and to become less motivated to support action to challenge social inequality. Thus, psychologists' tendency to equate intergroup harmony with ``good relations'' and conflict with ``bad relations'' is limited.},

  abstract = {Intergroup contact research has expanded exponentially in the last few decades, with researchers employing a widening range of methods to offer new insights into the effects of both positive and negative contact experiences. In this commentary, we discuss the contributions of three papers to this special issue of the Journal of Social Issues on advances in intergroup contact research, namely Sch{\"a}fer et al.'s (2021) review of research on negative intergroup contact experiences, H{\"a}ssler et al.'s (2020) review of research on intergroup contact and social change, and O'Donnell et al.'s (2021) review of technological and analytic advances in contact research. Having outlined the key arguments of each paper, we then offer some theoretical and methodological reflections, also discussing potential gaps, connections, opportunities, and future directions along the way. We end by reflecting on a common theme that permeates our commentary: the need to contextualize adequately the dynamics of intergroup contact across a range of everyday settings. Here we argue that to fully understand how to promote beneficial forms of intergroup contact, we need to consider more carefully how contact is experienced, enacted, and evaluated ``on the ground'' by participants themselves. This requires work of both theoretical and methodological innovation.},

  abstract = {The contact hypothesis proposes that interaction between members of different groups reduces intergroup prejudice if--and only if--certain optimal conditions are present. For over 50 years, research using this framework has explored the boundary conditions for ideal contact and has guided interventions to promote desegregation. Although supporting the contact hypothesis in principle, the authors critique some research practices that have come to dominate the field: (a) the prioritizing of the study of interactions occurring under rarefied conditions, (b) the reformulation of lay understandings of contact in terms of a generic typology of ideal dimensions, and (c) the use of shifts in personal prejudice as the primary measure of outcome. The authors argue that these practices have limited the contact hypothesis both as an explanation of the intergroup dynamics of desegregation and as a framework for promoting social psychological change. In so arguing, the authors look toward a complementary program of research on contact and desegregation.},

  abstract = {For most of the history of prejudice research, negativity has been treated as its emotional and cognitive signature, a conception that continues to dominate work on the topic. By this definition, prejudice occurs when we dislike or derogate members of other groups. Recent research, however, has highlighted the need for a more nuanced and ``inclusive'' (Eagly 2004) perspective on the role of intergroup emotions and beliefs in sustaining discrimination. On the one hand, several independent lines of research have shown that unequal intergroup relations are often marked by attitudinal complexity, with positive responses such as affection and admiration mingling with negative responses such as contempt and resentment. Simple antipathy is the exception rather than the rule. On the other hand, there is mounting evidence that nurturing bonds of affection between the advantaged and the disadvantaged sometimes entrenches rather than disrupts wider patterns of discrimination. Notably, prejudice reduction interventions may have ironic effects on the political attitudes of the historically disadvantaged, decreasing their perceptions of injustice and willingness to engage in collective action to transform social inequalities.These developments raise a number of important questions. Has the time come to challenge the assumption that negative evaluations are inevitably the cognitive and affective hallmarks of discrimination? Is the orthodox concept of prejudice in danger of side-tracking, if not obstructing, progress towards social justice in a fuller sense? What are the prospects for reconciling a prejudice reduction model of change, designed to get people to like one another more, with a collective action model of change, designed to ignite struggles to achieve intergroup equality?},

Its highest energy consumption compared to other brain networks and its intimate coupling with conscious awareness are both pointing to an overarching function. Many research streams support an evolutionarily adaptive role in envisioning experience to anticipate the future. The present paper proposes a process model that tries to explain how the DMN may implement continuous evaluation and prediction of the environment to guide behavior. DMN function is recast in mathematical terms of control theory and reinforcement learning based on Markov decision processes. We argue that our formal account of DMN function naturally accommodates as special cases the previously proposed cognitive accounts on (1) predictive coding, (2) semantic associations, and (3) a ``sentinel'' role. Moreover, this process model for the neural optimization of complex behavior in the DMN offers parsimonious explanations for recent experimental findings in animals and humans.},

Four modules were designed to introduce robot mechanisms as well as arts: Acting (anthropomorphism), Dance (robot movements), Music and Sounds (music composition), and Drawing (robot art). These modules provided children with basic knowledge about robotics and STEM and guided children to create a live robot theater play. A total of 16 students participated in the program, and 11 of them were involved in completing questionnaires and interviews regarding their perceptions towards robots, STEAM, and the afterschool program. Four afterschool program teachers participated in interviews, reflecting their perceptions of the program and observations of children's experiences during the program. Our findings suggest that the present program effectively maintained children's engagement and improved their interest in STEAM by connecting social robots and theater production. We conclude with design guidelines and recommendations for future research and programs.},

We then identify several research directions to address pressing theoretical and practical issues. These issues concern (a) group processes and intergroup relations, (b) intergroup contact in the context of multiple categorization, (c) structural- and individual-level processes, (d) a broader range of individual-level outcomes (e.g., health), and (e) impact on social change. Contact theory and research provides a comprehensive conceptual foundation, allied to a range of powerful empirical techniques, for important new advances and practical applications for improving intergroup relations and producing more equitable outcomes across groups.},

  abstract = {In this paper we explore gender issues in the maker movement using four different methods of data analysis: standardised questionnaires, analysis of makerspaces' social media, statistical analysis of machine use and the coding of interviews and focus groups. The objective is to give a voice to female makers and makerspace managers, looking at the maker movement from an inside perspective. The paper demonstrates how gendered stereotypes are still reproduced within the maker movement. Makerspaces still attract considerably more males than females and exhibit a primarily ``male'' culture, reflected in the interior design of places, or by the language and attitudes of their members. Females in makerspaces, however, often have a background in communications, arts or design, as opposed to the coding or engineering background of the males. Previous research has shown how machines and materials also take on gendered connotations. The ``genderisation'' of objects refers to an attributed gender-specific use of machines. An example here could be that 3D printing, which is more often used by female makers compared to male members of makerspaces. Our research also identifies promising approaches for tackling the issue of gender imbalance. The maker movement has significant potential to improve gender equality as younger generations bring societal change to makerspaces and break with stereotypes. One of the findings our paper puts forward is the lack of female role models, especially in leading positions. Our data suggest that the maker scene still has to develop a tradition in reflecting questions around gender stereotypes or their role in partly reproducing them. Hence, we argue that the maker community should be more attentive to this issue and should make a concerted effort to become more diverse. Overall, our case research did not reveal any explicit animosity to gender questions; on the contrary, male makers and most maker communities showed great interest in avoiding gender stereotyping. We suggest applying the Bechdel-Test as a simple tool for clarifying gender topics and encouraging self-reflection among makers. Overall, our paper aims to support makerspaces that want to make diversity part of their strategy for future growth.},

It has emerged as a result of a growing dissatisfaction with the {$<$}em{$>$}systems perspective{$<$}/em{$>$}, which tends to give an outwardly understanding, making men, machines and materials look alike and reducing work to algorithmic procedures, some of them candidates for inclusion into the edp programs.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}The tool perspective takes the {$<$}em{$>$}labour process{$<$}/em{$>$} as its origin rather than data or information flow, emphasising the development of tools to be used with skill by workers in control of the production.

We present preliminary findings of a qualitative analysis of 12 observations and interviews with RT attendees. We examine RT design and use aspects that either supported identity self-perception and projection or limited it.

This study extends the literature by examining to what extent those effects exist when the contact is online and also by examining which recategorization strategy would be more effective in producing positive outcomes for those groups. For this aim, students of the two universities---CU and ATU (higher and lower status, respectively)---in Adana, Turkey were made to contact in small groups on a text-based online platform. Participants were distributed into four-people groups---either mixed of ATU and CU students or ATU students only. Either a common ingroup identity or dual identities were made salient in the mixed groups, whereas the individual identity was made salient in the groups consisting of ATU students only. Data were collected at three time periods: Two weeks before (368 participants), immediately after (159 participants), and one month after the contact (138 participants). Concerning outgroup attitudes, irrespective of salient identities, mixed groups improved attitudes, sustained in follow-up. Regarding collective action intentions, CU students' intentions increased (T1 to T3), while for ATU students in all groups, intentions decreased-whether cross-group contact was experienced or not.},

  abstract = {With increased focus on historically excluded populations, there have been recent calls for HCI research methods to more adequately acknowledge and address the historical context of racism, sexism, gendered racism, epistemic violence, classism, and so on. In this article, we utilize Black feminist epistemologies to serve as critical frameworks for understanding the historical context that reveals the interconnected systems of power that mutually influence one another to create unequal outcomes or social inequalities for different populations. Leveraging Black feminist thought (BFT) and intersectionality as critical social theories of design praxis, we introduce intersectional analysis of power---a method that enables HCI researchers, designers, and practitioners to identify and situate saturated sites of violence in a historical context and to transform the ways in which they engage with populations that have been historically oppressed. Engaging in self-reflection as researchers, we apply an intersectional analysis of power to co-design technologies with community street outreach workers who address violence in their predominantly Black communities. We: (1) identify the saturated site of violence; (2) identify the intersecting systems of power and who holds power (past and present); (3) describe the ``conceptual glue'' that binds these intersecting systems together and the assumption(s) that those who hold power are employing to guide their interactions; (4) examine the ways in which Black people are subjugated, surveilled, and/or expected to assimilate to ``normative'' ways of being and behaving; and (5) identify acts of resistance. This article contributes an alternative to traditional HCI and design methods that falsely perpetuate a lens of neutrality and colorblindness that centers on whiteness, innovation, and capitalism and ignores the history of State-sanctioned violence and structural oppression.},

Through an analysis of an artistic process aimed to deliver a commissioned opera where custom-built drones are performing on stage alongside human performers, we observed the importance of achieving an intercorporeal understanding to shape body-based emotional expressivity. Our analysis reveals how the choreographer moves herself to: (1) imitate and feel the affordances and expressivity of the drones' 'otherness' through her own bodily experience; (2) communicate to the engineer of the team how she wants to alter the drones' behaviors to be more expressive; (3) enact and interactively alter her choreography. Through months of intense development and creative work, such an intercorporeal understanding was achieved by carefully crafting the drones' behaviors, but also by the choreographer adjusting her own somatics and expressions. The choreography arose as a result of the expressivity they enabled together.},

There has been little development of a theory focusing on the multi-faceted nature of both spatial and group boundaries, and the interlinkages between them. An analysis of the boundary concept within the context of the Israeli-Arab conflict points to the importance of understanding both internal and external perceptions of threat. This is reflected in the dual political discourse of physical security and space purification, the former being used as a means of securing territorial boundaries, the latter in an attempt to obtain boundaries between competing national groups. Idealistic solutions to the Israeli-Arab conflict would result from an emphasis on human rights as an alternative to the traditional spatial discourse.},

We relate each embodiment component to the most often used assessment measures, test tasks, and application scenarios. The toolbox is built to efficiently design, test, and assess an embodiment experience, following seven concrete steps. We provide four main contributions: 1) a literature review of the assessment measures and strategies used to measure SoE; 2) a systematic categorization of SoE measures; 3) A categorization of the main test tasks used in SoE assessment; and 4) a toolbox consisting of seven steps as guidance to design SoE. We included several examples and tables to guide the user step by step through the design of an embodiment experience.},

  abstract = {Drones inhabit live performance spaces from Cirque du Soleil to the Olympics. Can Human Drone Interaction (HDI) research learn from live performance? This paper positions HDI research within a formal performance framework. We build on existing HDI and performance collaborations through Laban Movement Analysis (LMA), and present findings from a Performance Workshop (PW) conducted with professional performers focusing on the unique expressive qualities of drones. Our findings expand on LMA and contribute a drone-specific movement lexicon and framework for use in HDI research that introduces height and proximity as key factors in nonverbal communication. Additionally, we explore live performance applications as a new design space and classification system for HDI research use cases. We suggest that performance approaches can result in more intentionally expressive drones that improve communication providing deeper connections with human actors on stage and with audience members.},

This paper tests associations between Zoom Fatigue and five theoretical nonverbal mechanisms (mirror anxiety, being physically trapped, hyper gaze from a grid of staring faces, and the cognitive load from producing and interpreting nonverbal cues) with 10,591 participants from a convenience sample. We show that daily usage predicts the amount of fatigue, and that women have longer meetings and shorter breaks between meetings than men. Moreover, women report greater fatigue than men, and we replicate this effect with an online sample. The five nonverbal mechanisms predict Zoom fatigue, and we confirm that mirror anxiety, measured both by self-report and by linguistic analysis of open-ended responses, mediates the gender difference in fatigue. Exploratory research shows that race, age, and personality relate to fatigue. We discuss avenues for future research and strategies to decrease Zoom fatigue.},

  abstract = {Background: Maternal--newborn contact enhances organization of the infant's physiological systems, including stress reactivity, autonomic functioning, and sleep patterns, and supports maturation of the prefrontal cortex and its ensuing effects on cognitive and behavioral control. Premature birth disrupts brain development and is associated with maternal separation and disturbances of contactsensitive systems. However, it is unknown whether the provision of maternal--preterm contact can improve long-term functioning of these systems. Methods: We used the Kangaroo Care (KC) intervention and provided maternal--newborn skin-to-skin contact to 73 premature infants for 14 consecutive days compared with 73 case-matched control subjects receiving standard incubator care. Children were then followed seven times across the first decade of life and multiple physiologic, cognitive, parental mental health, and mother--child relational measures were assessed. Results: KC increased autonomic functioning (respiratory sinus arrhythmia, RSA) and maternal attachment behavior in the postpartum period, reduced maternal anxiety, and enhanced child cognitive development and executive functions from 6 months to 10 years. By 10 years of age, children receiving KC showed attenuated stress response, improved RSA, organized sleep, and better cognitive control. RSA and maternal behavior were dynamically interrelated over time, leading to improved physiology, executive functions, and mother--child reciprocity at 10 years. Conclusions: These findings are the first to demonstrate long-term effects of early touch-based intervention on children's physiologic organization and behavioral control and have salient implications for the care practices of premature infants. Results demonstrate the dynamic cascades of child physiological regulation and parental provisions in shaping developmental outcome and may inform the construction of more targeted early interventions.},

However, the existing FPAs generally suffer from small output force, limiting users' applications. This letter presents a new class of high-force FPAs (HFFPAs) that harness asymmetric chambers and interference-reinforced structure for soft wearable assistive gloves. Different from the classical FPAs with symmetric chamber (i.e., Line chamber) fabricated by two identical layers of textiles, we design FPAs with asymmetric chambers (i.e., Arch and Semicircle chambers) fabricated by two unidentical layers of textiles. To further improve the output force, we introduce interference pads on adjacent-pleat surfaces to reinforce the stiffness of the FPAs. We next characterize the joint torque and the tip blocked force of six kinds of FPAs (i.e., Line, Line-pad, Arch, Arch-pad, Semicircle, and Semicircle-pad FPAs). Experimental results demonstrate that the Semicircle-pad FPA shows the best performance, whose joint torque and tip blocked force are improved by 510\% and 478\% at 150 kPa than the commonly used Line FPA. We further integrate HFFPAs on soft wearable assistive gloves and verify the improved assistive capability in grasping multiscale objects with irregular geometry, covering a wide weight range (8-559 g) in activities of daily living (ADLs).},

However, existing m-SPAs have slow actuation speed and are either limited by a finite air supply or require energy-consuming hardware to continuously supply compressed air. Here, we address these shortcomings by introducing an internal exhaust air recirculation (IEAR) mechanism for high-speed and low-energy actuation of m-SPAs. This mechanism recirculates the exhaust compressed air and recovers the energy by harnessing the rhythmic actuation of multiple chambers. We develop a theoretical model to guide the analysis of the IEAR mechanism, which agrees well with the experimental results. Comparative experimental results of several sets of m-SPAs show that our IEAR mechanism significantly improves the actuation speed by more than 82.4\% and reduces the energy consumption per cycle by more than 47.7\% under typical conditions. We further demonstrate the promising applications of the IEAR mechanism in various pneumatic soft machines and robots such as a robotic fin, fabric-based finger, and quadruped robot.

This approach seeks to examine critically how the social and material not only are entangled in what some call ``assemblages'' of the human and nonhuman, but also constitute the practices and knowings that comprise education. The chapter focuses in particular on methodologies for researching professional learning and knowing as sociomaterial practice. We draw examples from three doctoral studies-in-progress of learning in different settings: engineers in project teams developing environmental technologies, artists learning to balance multiple activities of art, market and bureaucracy, and health-care workers learning to implement a new technology in a paediatric diabetes clinic. These examples illustrate the insights as well as the dilemmas in working with sociomaterial approaches to make visible the materialities of learning. One key contribution here is the first hand voices of new researchers experimenting with these approaches. The methods and theories are difficult to apply, and the stories here help to reveal the strategies that student researchers adopted to work through the challenges of sociomaterial approaches.},

  abstract = {Context In current debates about professional practice and education, increasing emphasis is placed on understanding learning as a process of ongoing participation rather than one of acquiring knowledge and skills. However, although this socio-cultural view is important and useful, issues have emerged in studies of practice-based learning that point to certain oversights. Methods Three issues are described here: (i) the limited attention paid to the importance of materiality -- objects, technologies, nature, etc. -- in questions of learning; (ii) the human-centric view of practice that fails to note the relations among social and material forces, and (iii) the conflicts between ideals of evidence-based standardised models and the sociomaterial contingencies of clinical practice. Discussion It is argued here that a socio-material approach to practice and learning offers important insights for medical education. This view is in line with a growing field of research in the materiality of everyday life, which embraces wide-ranging families of theory that can be only briefly mentioned in this short paper. The main premise they share is that social and material forces, culture, nature and technology, are enmeshed in everyday practice. Objects and humans act upon one another in ways that mutually transform their characteristics and activity. Examples from research in medical practice show how materials actively influence clinical practice, how learning itself is a material matter, how protocols are in fact temporary sociomaterial achievements, and how practices form unique and sometimes conflicting sociomaterial worlds, with diverse diagnostic and treatment approaches for the same thing. Conclusions This discussion concludes with implications for learning in practice. What is required is a shift from an emphasis on acquiring knowledge to participating more wisely in particular situations. This focus is on learning how to attune to minor material fluctuations and surprises, how to track one's own and others' effects on `intra-actions' and emerging effects, and how to improvise solutions.},

We propose that one method of facilitating improved intergroup attitudes, a sense of community, and collective action intentions is Forum Theater (Boal, 1989); we tested this prediction in postwar Liberia. In 2 communities, 218 diverse Liberians participated in a field experiment evaluating 2 Forum Theater plays (one about rebuilding trust following intergroup conflict and one about a public health issue); we also included a control group that did not receive any intervention. Both Forum Theater interventions increased participants' sense of community and willingness to engage in collective action. Only the play about intergroup conflict increased intergroup trust and reduced social distance toward a disliked group. Specifically tailored Forum Theater thus has the potential to improve intergroup attitudes, sense of community, and collective action intentions in postconflict societies.

The concurrent measurement of these complementary trace species in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere allows inferring exchange processes in the tropopause region. Whereas an advanced H2O differential absorption lidar at 935 nm has successfully been developed and extensively tested at DLR in the past, we describe here an amendment of this lidar by the addition of an ultraviolet (UV) channel to measure ozone. The transmitter of the ozone differential absorption lidar (DIAL) is based on a near-IR optical parametric oscillator that is frequency-converted into the UV spectral range by intracavity sum frequency mixing. Hereby, a continuous UV tuning range of {$\sim$}297--317\,\,nm has been achieved. The average output power in this range is higher than 1 W corresponding to more than 10 mJ per pulse at a repetition rate of 100 Hz. The ozone DIAL system has been carefully characterized both on the ground and in flight. The first simultaneously measured two-dimensional cross-sections of ozone and water vapor in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere have been recorded during the Wave-driven Isentropic Exchange (WISE) field campaign in 2017 demonstrating the high potential of this system for studying exchange processes in this region of the atmosphere.},

Researchers, designers, and engineers have proposed socially assistive robots as one way of helping elderly people stay in their homes longer. In a systematic literature review, this paper wants to investigate if and how evaluations of the acceptance of socially assistive robots by older people take into account sociodemographic factors. The results indicate that this only holds true for a few studies. Research that incorporates age, gender, education, and so forth; clearly shows that these key factors have a significant impact. However, the relations are complex and experience with technology mitigates the influence of sociodemographic factors on acceptance. Assistive devices should be adaptable to individual needs to be able to consider all these factors.},

  abstract = {In Bayesian statistics, the marginal likelihood, also known as the evidence, is used to evaluate model fit as it quantifies the joint probability of the data under the prior. In contrast, non-Bayesian models are typically compared using cross-validation on held-out data, either through \$k\$-fold partitioning or leave-\$p\$-out subsampling. We show that the marginal likelihood is formally equivalent to exhaustive leave-\$p\$-out crossvalidation averaged over all values of \$p\$ and all held-out test sets when using the log posterior predictive probability as the scoring rule. Moreover, the log posterior predictive score is the only coherent scoring rule under data exchangeability. This offers new insight into the marginal likelihood and cross-validation, and highlights the potential sensitivity of the marginal likelihood to the choice of the prior. We suggest an alternative approach using cumulative cross-validation following a preparatory training phase. Our work has connections to prequential analysis and intrinsic Bayes factors, but is motivated in a different way.},

A meta-analysis (N = 32) examined the model of social influence in virtual environments (Blascovich, 2002) and investigated whether agents and avatars in virtual environments elicit different levels of social influence. Results indicated that perceived avatars produced stronger responses than perceived agents. Level of immersion (desktop vs. fully immersive), dependent variable type (subjective vs. objective), task type (competitive vs. cooperative vs. neutral), and actual control of the representation (human vs. computer) were examined as moderators. An interaction effect revealed that studies conducted on a desktop that used objective measures showed a stronger effect for agency than those that were conducted on a desktop but used subjective measures. Competitive and cooperative tasks showed greater agency effects than neutral tasks. Studies in which both conditions were actually human controlled showed greater agency effects than studies in which both conditions were actually computer controlled. We discuss theoretical and design implications for human--computer interaction and computer-mediated communication.},

This task is complicated by differing interpretations of how new materialist precepts should shape research. This paper aims to fill a gap in the literature by setting out a methodology using one specific thread within the new materialisms: Deleuzian `ethology'. Inspired by Spinoza's Ethics, Deleuze established a conceptual toolkit for ethological inquiry, comprising `relation', `assemblage', `affect' and `capacity'. We show how this toolkit translates into a design for analysing empirical data. Effective data analysis also depends on the adequacy and appropriateness of earlier stages in the research process. We therefore also consider an ethological approach to setting a research question, choosing data collection methods and presenting study findings. We conclude with some reflections on the challenges of translating philosophical theory into social science methodology.},

Objectification theory suggests that women's exposure to sexualized media representations leads to self-objectification. Further, we anticipated this process would lead to increases in rape myth acceptance (RMA). Two experiments (Study 1, N = 87; Study 2, N = 81) examined the effects of avatar features on women's experiences of self-objectification. In both studies, college women exposed to sexualized avatars experienced higher levels of self-objectification after the virtual experience than those exposed to nonsexualized avatars. Furthermore, in Study 2, self-objectification mediated the relationship between controlling a sexualized avatar and subsequent levels of RMA. We discuss the implications of women using sexualized avatars in video games and virtual environments, which may lead to negative attitudes about the self and other women off-line due to heightened self-objectification.

However, while there is a massive body of research on their design and acceptance in different fields of application, their market potential has been rarely investigated. As their future integration in society may have a vast disruptive potential, this work aims at shedding light on the market potential, focusing on the assistive health domain. A study with 197 persons from Italy (age: M = 67.87; SD = 8.87) and Germany (age: M = 62.15; SD = 6.14) investigates cultural acceptance, desired functionalities, and purchase preferences. The participants filled in a questionnaire after watching a video illustrating some examples of social robots. Surprisingly, the individual perception of health status, social status as well as nationality did hardly influence the attitude towards social robots, although the German group was somewhat more reluctant to the idea of using them. Instead, there were significant correlations with most dimensions of the Almere model (like perceived enjoyment, sociability, usefulness and trustworthiness). Also, technology acceptance resulted strongly correlated with the individual readiness to invest money. However, as most persons consider social robots as ``Assistive Technological Devices'' (ATDs), they expected that their provision should mirror the usual practices followed in the two Countries for such devices. Thus, to facilitate social robots' future visibility and adoption by both individuals and health care organisations, policy makers would need to start integrating them into official ATDs databases.},

Today's prosthetic devices, struggling to provide similar functions, become overly complex and expensive. They are composed of multiple, precise parts, including miniaturised actuators and sensors as well as complex control, to satisfy the manipulation tasks required. In this paper we propose a soft pneumatic hand that adapts passively to the handled object due to its mechanical compliance. It is pressure driven and enables individual fingers to be controlled independently for dexterity or in groups when a synergistic finger movement is needed. The hand has a truly anatomical shape, is easy to replace and cheap in production. The design can be easily adjusted in terms of shape and size in order to fit each individual user. The paper presents the design, manufacturing technology, current control system and preliminary tests of the hand's capabilities.},

I look to post-humanism and relational ontologies to sketch what I call Entanglement HCI in response. I review selected theories---Actor-Network Theory, Post-Phenomenology, Object-Oriented Ontology, Agential Realism---and their existing influences on HCI literature. Against this background, I develop Entanglement HCI from the following four perspectives: (a) the performative relationship between humans and technology; (b) the re-framing of knowledge generation processes around phenomena; (c) the tracing of accountabilities, responsibilities and ethical encounters; and (d) the practices of design and mattering that move beyond user-centred design.},

Even if a centrist Israeli government emerges following the war, the most the Palestinians can probably hope for is heightened autonomy, not full independence. Israel may show greater willingness to consider civil disengagement -- that is, the dismantling of settlements in those parts of the West Bank that it would not wish to retain in a final peace settlement, probably over 90\% of them -- but with the Israel Defense Forces fully deployed throughout the area. Saudi--Israeli normalisation has been postponed, but may be salvageable, especially if the Saudis take an active role in the peace process and in reinstating the Palestinian Authority in Gaza. Growing tensions could diminish the extraordinary US--Israeli strategic cooperation that arose immediately after the attack.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we introduce an active inference model of ant colony foraging behavior, and implement the model in a series of in silico experiments. Active inference is a multiscale approach to behavioral modeling that is being applied across settings in theoretical biology and ethology. The ant colony is a classic case system in the function of distributed systems in terms of stigmergic decision-making and information sharing. Here we specify and simulate a Markov decision process (MDP) model for ant colony foraging. We investigate a well known paradigm from laboratory ant colony behavioral experiments, the alternating T-maze paradigm, to illustrate the ability of the model to recover basic colony phenomena such as trail formation after food location discovery. We conclude by outlining how the active inference ant colony foraging behavioral model can be extended and situated within a nested multiscale framework and systems approaches to biology more generally.},

Starting from the premise that all neuronal processing (and action selection) can be explained by maximizing Bayesian model evidence---or minimizing variational free energy---we ask whether neuronal responses can be described as a gradient descent on variational free energy. Using a standard (Markov decision process) generative model, we derive the neuronal dynamics implicit in this description and reproduce a remarkable range of well-characterized neuronal phenomena. These include repetition suppression, mismatch negativity, violation responses, place-cell activity, phase precession, theta sequences, theta-gamma coupling, evidence accumulation, race-to-bound dynamics, and transfer of dopamine responses. Furthermore, the (approximately Bayes' optimal) behavior prescribed by these dynamics has a degree of face validity, providing a formal explanation for reward seeking, context learning, and epistemic foraging. Technically, the fact that a gradient descent appears to be a valid description of neuronal activity means that variational free energy is a Lyapunov function for neuronal dynamics, which therefore conform to Hamilton's principle of least action.},

These steps entail (i) establishing a particular partition of states based upon conditional independencies that inherit from sparsely coupled dynamics, (ii) unpacking the implications of this partition in terms of Bayesian inference and (iii) describing the paths of particular states with a variational principle of least action. Teleologically, the free energy principle offers a normative account of self-organisation in terms of optimal Bayesian design and decision-making, in the sense of maximising marginal likelihood or Bayesian model evidence. In summary, starting from a description of the world in terms of random dynamical systems, we end up with a description of self-organisation as sentient behaviour that can be interpreted as self-evidencing; namely, self-assembly, autopoiesis or active inference.},

  abstract = {Adaptive agents must occupy a limited repertoire of states and therefore minimize the long-term average of surprise associated with sensory exchanges with the world. Minimizing surprise enables them to resist a natural tendency to disorder.Surprise rests on predictions about sensations, which depend on an internal generative model of the world. Although surprise cannot be measured directly, a free-energy bound on surprise can be, suggesting that agents minimize free energy by changing their predictions (perception) or by changing the predicted sensory inputs (action).Perception optimizes predictions by minimizing free energy with respect to synaptic activity (perceptual inference), efficacy (learning and memory) and gain (attention and salience). This furnishes Bayes-optimal (probabilistic) representations of what caused sensations (providing a link to the Bayesian brain hypothesis).Bayes-optimal perception is mathematically equivalent to predictive coding and maximizing the mutual information between sensations and the representations of their causes. This is a probabilistic generalization of the principle of efficient coding (the infomax principle) or the minimum-redundancy principle.Learning under the free-energy principle can be formulated in terms of optimizing the connection strengths in hierarchical models of the sensorium. This rests on associative plasticity to encode causal regularities and appeals to the same synaptic mechanisms as those underlying cell assembly formation.Action under the free-energy principle reduces to suppressing sensory prediction errors that depend on predicted (expected or desired) movement trajectories. This provides a simple account of motor control, in which action is enslaved by perceptual (proprioceptive) predictions.Perceptual predictions rest on prior expectations about the trajectory or movement through the agent's state space. These priors can be acquired (as empirical priors during hierarchical inference) or they can be innate (epigenetic) and therefore subject to selective pressure.Predicted motion or state transitions realized by action correspond to policies in optimal control theory and reinforcement learning. In this context, value is inversely proportional to surprise (and implicitly free energy), and rewards correspond to innate priors that constrain policies.},

We show that it is fairly simple to teach an agent complicated and adaptive behaviours using a free-energy formulation of perception. In this formulation, agents adjust their internal states and sampling of the environment to minimize their free-energy. Such agents learn causal structure in the environment and sample it in an adaptive and self-supervised fashion. This results in behavioural policies that reproduce those optimised by reinforcement learning and dynamic programming. Critically, we do not need to invoke the notion of reward, value or utility. We illustrate these points by solving a benchmark problem in dynamic programming; namely the mountain-car problem, using active perception or inference under the free-energy principle. The ensuing proof-of-concept may be important because the free-energy formulation furnishes a unified account of both action and perception and may speak to a reappraisal of the role of dopamine in the brain.},

This article analyses the Israeli and the Palestinian water discourse. On both sides, the dominant discourse structures underscore the conflictive issues regarding the distribution of water between Israelis and Palestinians, thus making communication, let alone negotiation, downright impossible. While Palestinians regard the natural water resources as sufficient in principle and the existing scarcity as entirely politically induced, Israelis perceive the natural water resources as absolutely scarce while receiving major de-securitisation impulses from the possibility of desalination. In the respective (minor) counter-discourses, however, possible starting points for dialogue and conflict resolution are visible.},

One important question is whether the nature of online engagements between groups relates to the nature of encounters between these groups in the real world. We analyzed online conversations that occurred between members of protest groups from opposite sides of the political spectrum, obtained from Facebook event pages used to organize upcoming political protests and rallies in the United States and the United Kingdom and the occurrence of violence during these protests and rallies. Using natural language processing and text analysis, we show that increased engagement between groups online is associated with increased violence when these groups met in the real world. The level of engagement between groups taking place online is substantial, and can be characterized as negative, brief, and low in integrative complexity. These findings suggest that opposing groups may use unstructured online environments to engage with one another in hostile ways. This may reflect a worsening of relationships, in turn explaining the observed increases in physical violence offline. These findings raise questions as to whether unstructured online communication is compatible with positive intergroup contact, and highlights the role that the Internet might play in wider issues of extremism and radicalization.},

To maintain control of posture and movement, he is forced to compensate for that loss by depending on the perceptual system of a body image that is modified in important respects.

This review examines two important concepts of self: the 'minimal self', a self devoid of temporal extension, and the 'narrative self', which involves personal identity and continuity across time. The notion of a minimal self is first clarified by drawing a distinction between the sense of self-agency and the sense of self-ownership for actions. This distinction is then explored within the neurological domain with specific reference to schizophrenia, in which the sense of self-agency may be disrupted. The convergence between the philosophical debate and empirical study is extended in a discussion of more primitive aspects of self and how these relate to neonatal experience and robotics. The second concept of self, the narrative self, is discussed in the light of Gazzaniga's left-hemisphere 'interpreter' and episodic memory. Extensions of the idea of a narrative self that are consistent with neurological models are then considered. The review illustrates how the philosophical approach can inform cognitive science and suggests that a two-way collaboration may lead to a more fully developed account of the self.},

  abstract = {Established design and fabrication guidelines exist for achieving a variety of motions with soft actuators such as bending, contraction, extension, and twisting. These guidelines typically involve multi-step molding of composite materials (elastomers, paper, fiber, etc.) along with specially designed geometry. In this paper we present the design and fabrication of a robust, fiber-reinforced soft bending actuator where its bend radius and bending axis can be mechanically-programed with a flexible, selectively-placed conformal covering that acts to mechanically constrain motion. Several soft actuators were fabricated and their displacement and force capabilities were measured experimentally and compared to demonstrate the utility of this approach. Finally, a prototype two-digit end-effector was designed and programmed with the conformal covering to shape match a rectangular object. We demonstrated improved gripping force compared to a pure bending actuator. We envision this approach enabling rapid customization of soft actuator function for grasping applications where the geometry of the task is known a priori.},

Intergroup dialogue and Theatre of the Oppressed are two approaches that effectively meet these challenges. Intergroup dialogue offers a systematic method of creating safety, exploring and owning social identity, engaging in hot topics, and ally building. Theatre of the Oppressed promotes communications that allow creative delving into sensitive topics. Data are presented from a cohort of students in a social work undergraduate oppression class. An ethnographic method was implemented to review student responses to a pedagogical approach that combined intergroup dialogue and Theatre of the Oppressed. Data analysis revealed students' increased self-reflection and perspective taking.},

We investigate the mechanical behaviors of various woven fabrics and rib weft-knitted fabric structures, guiding us to design a thumb-abduction SFPA, a finger-flexion SFPA, and a finger-extension SFPA. We further develop a mathematical model to evaluate the influence of the geometric parameters on the blocked tip forces of the fingerflexion SFPAs and extension torques of the finger-extension SFPAs, which are also verified by the experimental results. We then integrate our SFPAs into a soft wearable assistive glove with a portable control system. The glove is finally tested on a healthy volunteer and a brachial plexus injury patient. The clinical evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our designed glove in assisting hand motions and grasping tasks.},

Design for equivalence is a theoretical contribution that emerges from a critical analysis of Chantal Mouffe's theory of agonistic pluralism in PD. In this paper, we first review Mouffe's conceptualization of agonism arguing a key construct of her theory---the chain of equivalence---has been absent in recent PD formulations of agonistic pluralism that seek to create collective, counter-hegemonic, and emancipatory responses to complex social problems. Next, we discuss the implications of these formulations relative to PD practices, participants, and outcomes. Lastly, we develop an approach that offers a set of provisional, practical guiding principles for PD processes to challenge structural inequality by creating articulations of the common good that are strong enough to counter power.},

At first instance, for the purposes of this paper, I ask whether it is appropriate to draw on the cultural property paradigm in order to spotlight the possibilities and significance of claiming their cuisine as the intangible cultural heritage of Palestinians. This essay is a rhetorical cry for the repatriation and rehabilitation of regional specialties. The need to acknowledge, safeguard and celebrate Palestinian culture, its distinctive genius and the abundance and refinement of its traditions is part of the struggle for meaningful political change.

Technology can support the scaling of Youth-Led Participatory Action Research (YPAR), in which adolescents conduct research to improve issues that affect them. We present the first known published systematic review of the use of technology to scale YPAR. Methods A systematic review of the empirical literature was conducted from 2000 to 2018 using databases PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO, and PubMed. The review included peer-reviewed articles of YPAR studies involving adolescents (aged 10--19~years) using technology for scaling. Appraisal of papers included the role of technology and consistency with YPAR principles. Results Nine peer-reviewed YPAR publications focusing on a range of health issues with adolescents aged 11--19~years were identified. Technology included Facebook (most common), Twitter, Instagram, Skype, e-mail, blogs, and personalized mapping applications. Overall, technology was primarily used for adolescent participants to gather data. The appraisal revealed the complexities inherent in conducting YPAR using technology across multiple sites, with different adults in supportive roles and varying levels of opportunities for adolescent engagement. Conclusions This review provides insights at the intersection of youth-led research and technology, highlighting opportunities in a changing technological landscape and the challenges of YPAR at scale.},

Action research has become an important part of a number of research programs, especially in the field of education. Action research is a powerful idea centering on humans' ability to break free from deleterious social habits through autonomous, democratic participation. Action research was originally conceived as an adult education program influenced by the work of Eduard Lindeman, Kurt Lewin, John Dewey, and Jean Piaget.A second branch of action research, participatory action research, emerged about 5 years later guided by the sociological work of William Foote Whyte. Participatory action research focused less on democratic processes and egalitarian decision making and more on understanding organizational problems through the eyes of the participants. Chris Argyris and Eric Trist both extended action research in new directions by merging new ideas.},

There's an entire not-understanding-Karl-Friston internet fandom, complete with its own parody Twitter account and Markov blanket memes. From the journal Neuropsychoanalysis (which based on its name I predict is a center of expertise in not understanding things): At Columbia's psychiatry department, I recently led a journal club for 15 PET and fMRI researhers, PhDs and MDs all, with well over \$10 million in NIH grants between us, and we tried to understand Friston's 2010 Nature Reviews Neuroscience paper -- for an hour and a half. There was a lot of mathematical knowledge in the room: three statisticians, two physicists, a physical chemist, a nuclear physicist, and a large group of neuroimagers -- but apparently we didn't have what it took. I met with a Princeton physicist, a Stanford neurophysiologist, a Cold Springs Harbor neurobiologist to discuss the paper. Again blanks, one and all.Normally this is the point at which I give up and say ``screw it''. But almost all the most interesting neuroscience of the past decade involves this guy in one way or another. He's the most-cited living neuroscientist, invented large parts of modern brain imaging, and received of the prestigious Golden Brain Award for excellence in neuroscience, which is somehow a real thing. His Am I Autistic -- An Intellectual Autobiography short essay, written in a weirdly lucid style and describing hijinks like deriving the Schrodinger equation for fun in school, is as consistent with genius as anything I've ever read.  As for free energy, it's been dubbed ``a unified brain theory'' (Friston 2010), a key through which ``nearly every aspect of [brain] anatomy and physiology starts to make sense'' (Friston 2009), ``[the source of] the ability of biological systems to resist a natur},

  abstract = {The present study focuses on the effect of vicarious intergroup contact and the support of an authority figure on the improvement of outgroup and meta-stereotype evaluations. Meta-stereotype refers to the shared beliefs of ingroup members about how they consider outgroup members to perceive their group. Three preliminary studies were carried out to determine desirable and undesirable characteristics for a good basketball performance, the task that best demonstrates the application of these characteristics, and the two groups (basketball teams) that should be involved in the vicarious intergroup contact. Fans of one of the basketball teams participated in the current study. Vicarious intergroup contact improved outgroup and meta-stereotype evaluations as compared with a no contact condition. In addition, the positive effects of vicarious intergroup contact significantly increased when it was supported by an authority figure. More importantly, our study also shows that the improvement of outgroup evaluation was partially mediated by changes on meta-stereotypes.},

One area for understanding the impact of robots on human society is interracial relations. Would robots constitute a nonhuman outgroup to trigger human ingroup favoritism which will confine the boundary of racial prejudice? A study (N=105) assessed Whites' rank-ordered preferences for 15 White, Black and robot computer-synthesized characters. Explicit racial prejudice positively predicted White versus Black character preferences for liking and as one's avatar, virtual friend, and virtual tutor. The implicit racial prejudice, measured with the Implicit Association Test (IAT), provided additional predictive utility for virtual friend. Among the 64 participants who reported minimal interest in robots, explicit racial prejudice negatively predicted preferences for Black over robot characters, showing a pattern that individuals with high prejudice preferred robot characters over Black ones. The results suggest alarming strength of racial prejudice and cast doubt on the notion of all-human ingroup favoritism in comparison to robots.},

  abstract = {Inside virtual reality, users can embody avatars that are collocated from a first-person perspective. When doing so, participants have the feeling that the own body has been substituted by the self-avatar, and that the new body is the source of the sensations. Embodiment is complex as it includes not only body ownership over the avatar, but also agency, co-location, and external appearance. Despite the multiple variables that influence it, the illusion is quite robust, and it can be produced even if the self-avatar is of a different age, size, gender, or race from the participant's own body. Embodiment illusions are therefore the basis for many social VR experiences and a current active research area among the community. Researchers are interested both in the body manipulations that can be accepted, as well as studying how different self-avatars produce different attitudinal, social, perceptual, and behavioral effects. However, findings suggest that despite embodiment being strongly associated with the performance and reactions inside virtual reality, the extent to which the illusion is experienced varies between participants. In this paper, we review the questionnaires used in past experiments and propose a standardized embodiment questionnaire based on 25 questions that are prevalent in the literature. We encourage future virtual reality experiments that include first-person virtual avatars to administer this questionnaire in order to evaluate the degree of embodiment.},

Our main focus concerns the similarity between users and avatars, a factor known as truthfulness. Our experiment requires the participants to control three avatars using a third-person perspective: a robot, a suit and their virtual doppelganger (virtual representation of the self). In order to analyze users' reactions and strategies, each task of the scenario of the virtual reality application can potentially affect the integrity of their characters. Our results revealed that ownership, one of the three factors of the sense of embodiment, is higher for the participants controlling their self-representation than with abstract representations. Furthermore, avatar visual fidelity seems to affect users' subjective experience, half of the panel reported having different behavior depending on the controlled character. Abstract representations allow the users to adopt more risky behaviors, while self-representations maintain a connection with the real world and encourage users to preserve the integrity of their avatar.},

  abstract = {The concept of free energy has its origins in 19th century thermodynamics, but has recently found its way into the behavioral and neural sciences, where it has been promoted for its wide applicability and has even been suggested as a fundamental principle of understanding intelligent behavior and brain function. We argue that there are essentially two different notions of free energy in current models of intelligent agency, that can both be considered as applications of Bayesian inference to the problem of action selection: one that appears when trading off accuracy and uncertainty based on a general maximum entropy principle, and one that formulates action selection in terms of minimizing an error measure that quantifies deviations of beliefs and policies from given reference models. The first approach provides a normative rule for action selection in the face of model uncertainty or when information processing capabilities are limited. The second approach directly aims to formulate the action selection problem as an inference problem in the context of Bayesian brain theories, also known as Active Inference in the literature. We elucidate the main ideas and discuss critical technical and conceptual issues revolving around these two notions of free energy that both claim to apply at all levels of decision-making, from the high-level deliberation of reasoning down to the low-level information processing of perception.},

A range of theoretical approaches to applied drama are examined in the light of practical examples of applied puppetry using case studies in Northern Ireland, South Africa and Australia. Morton (2013) highlighted how in performance `tension between the material puppet and the imagined puppet' gives rise to a kind of ``double vision'' (Tillis), a concept that the paper considers alongside Brecht's V-effekt, Meyerhold's distinction between the materiality and agency of the actor, and Boal's idea of metaxis. The paper concludes that the distancing and conductive qualities of applied puppetry often work in parallel and that the puppet can be seen as the site of metaxis when used in an applied context.},

The Integrative Art Projects' value co-- creation enhances hedonic and eudaimonic well-being, when four pre-requisites are met: contact, equal status, common goal, and a social authority. This study accordingly advances understanding of the value co-creation in transformative services through the intergroup contact theory and confirms Integrative Art Projects as transformative services that foster integration. Consequently, arts managers should maintain co-- creation as a collaborative, customer-specific process and provide space for equal- level exchanges to ensure the integrative power of art projects.},

  abstract = {Objective Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is a structured group program that employs mindfulness meditation to alleviate suffering associated with physical, psychosomatic and psychiatric disorders. The program, nonreligious and nonesoteric, is based upon a systematic procedure to develop enhanced awareness of moment-to-moment experience of perceptible mental processes. The approach assumes that greater awareness will provide more veridical perception, reduce negative affect and improve vitality and coping. In the last two decades, a number of research reports appeared that seem to support many of these claims. We performed a comprehensive review and meta-analysis of published and unpublished studies of health-related studies related to MBSR. Methods Sixty-four empirical studies were found, but only 20 reports met criteria of acceptable quality or relevance to be included in the meta-analysis. Reports were excluded due to (1) insufficient information about interventions, (2) poor quantitative health evaluation, (3) inadequate statistical analysis, (4) mindfulness not being the central component of intervention, or (5) the setting of intervention or sample composition deviating too widely from the health-related MBSR program. Acceptable studies covered a wide spectrum of clinical populations (e.g., pain, cancer, heart disease, depression, and anxiety), as well as stressed nonclinical groups. Both controlled and observational investigations were included. Standardized measures of physical and mental well-being constituted the dependent variables of the analysis. Results Overall, both controlled and uncontrolled studies showed similar effect sizes of approximately 0.5 (P{$<$}.0001) with homogeneity of distribution. Conclusion Although derived from a relatively small number of studies, these results suggest that MBSR may help a broad range of individuals to cope with their clinical and nonclinical problems.},

The latter was actually an embodied agent (a computer-controlled digital representation of a human). Study 1 examined the extent to which gender of the virtual human, participant gender, and the agent's behavior affected attitude change. Results revealed gender-based ingroup favoritism in the form of greater attitude change for same gender virtual humans. Study 2 examined behavioral realism and agency beliefs; that is, whether participants believed the other to be an agent or an avatar (an online representation of an actual person). Results supported Blascovich and colleague's model of social influence within immersive virtual environments. Specifically, the prediction that virtual humans high in behavioral realism would be more influential than those low in behavioral realism was supported, but this effect was moderated by the gender of the virtual human and the research participant. Implications of these findings for the model are discussed.},

  abstract = {Social institutions emerge from social practices which coordinate activities by the explicit statement of rules, goals, and values. When artificial social actors are introduced into the physical and symbolic space of institutions, will this affect or transform institutional structures and practices, and how can social robotics as an interdisciplinary endeavor contribute to the ability of our institutions to perform their functions in society? This book presents the proceedings of Robophilosophy 2022, the 5th in the biennial Robophilosophy conference series, held in Helsinki, Finland, from 16 to 19 August 2022. The theme of this edition of the conference was Social Robots in Social Institutions, and it featured international multidisciplinary research from the humanities and social sciences concerning social robotics. The 63 papers, 41 workshop papers and 5 posters included in this book are divided into 4 sections: plenaries, sessions, workshops and posters, with the 41 papers in the `Sessions' section grouped into 13 subdivisions including elderly care, healthcare, law, education and art, as well as ethics and religion. These papers explore the anticipated conceptual and practical changes which will come about from the introduction of social robotics into public and private institutions, such as public services, legal systems, social and healthcare services or educational institutions. Offering an exploration of the societal significance of social robots for the future of social institutions, the book will be of interest to both researchers in robotics and to those working in social institutions and enterprises.},

The requirements of co-operation are identified from an interdisciplinary point of view. We divide cooperative creativity in message creativity, contextual creativity and communicative creativity.

  abstract = {Background: Pain perception and management vary across cultural contexts; yet, little is known about pain approaches in the general population of Palestine. Existing research lacks specific knowledge about how pain is coped with in this region. Objective: To explore pain management among Palestine's general population, studying prevalence, characteristics, and sociodemographic influences. It aims to uncover treatment choices and understand cultural impacts on pain experiences, offering insights into Palestinian pain perception and coping strategies. Methods: Convenience and snowball sampling methods were employed to collect data from 646 adults in Palestine. Participants' sociodemographic characteristics, pain experiences, and pain management strategies were examined. Descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, and binary logistic regression followed by multiple logistic regressions were used for data analysis. Results: A significant portion of participants reported experiencing pain, with chronic pain being predominant. Pain prevalence varied across age groups, with higher rates in the elderly, followed by middle-aged and younger participants. Marital status and education level were linked to pain prevalence. Participants employed diverse pain management strategies, such as self-medication, physician visits, complementary medicine, and physical therapy. Age, gender, marital status, and education level influenced choices in pain management approaches. For instance, the elderly favored traditional medical interventions, while higher education levels were associated with reduced inclination toward conventional treatments. Conclusion: This study underscores the complex interaction of sociodemographic factors, pain experiences, and treatment preferences in pain management. It emphasizes personalized strategies considering age, marital status, education, and gender. Integrating these aspects improves treatment and satisfaction. The findings empower healthcare providers to create precise strategies, enhancing patient experiences for better outcomes.},

  abstract = {In the current paper, we report a large-scale randomized field experiment, conducted among Jewish Israelis during widespread violence. The study examines the effectiveness of a ``real world,'' multichanneled paradoxical thinking intervention, with messages disseminated through various means of communication (i.e., online, billboards, flyers). Over the course of 6 wk, we targeted a small city in the center of Israel whose population is largely rightwing and religious. Based on the paradoxical thinking principles, the intervention involved transmission of messages that are extreme but congruent with the shared Israeli ethos of conflict. To examine the intervention's effectiveness, we conducted a large-scale field experiment (prepost design) in which we sampled participants from the city population (n = 215) and compared them to a control condition (from different places of residence) with similar demographic and political characteristics (n = 320). Importantly, participants were not aware that the intervention was related to the questionnaires they answered. Results showed that even in the midst of a cycle of ongoing violence within the context of one of the most intractable conflicts in the world, the intervention led hawkish participants to decrease their adherence to conflict-supporting attitudes across time. Furthermore, compared with the control condition, hawkish participants that were exposed to the paradoxical thinking intervention expressed less support for aggressive policies that the government should consider as a result of the escalation in violence and more support for conciliatory policies to end the violence and promote a long-lasting agreement.},

Their status as a national indigenous minority places them in a particular location of subordination and existential insecurity within Israeli society, which has been accentuated during the intensification of conflict between Israel and the Palestinians in the occupied territories since 2000. This study examines processes of identity negotiation and reconciliation in the personal narratives of young Palestinian citizens of Israel who participate in intergroup contact with Jewish Israelis and Palestinians from the occupied territories. An interpretive thematic analysis of personal narratives reveals the discursive strategies youth employ as they traverse the limits of hyphenation, constructing configurations of identity that reconcile conflicting discourses. Pre-contact narratives suggested considerable variability in processes of identity negotiation. Post-contact narratives were characterized by three patterns: (1) Palestinian identity accentuation, in which youth came to identify more strongly with their Palestinian national identity over their Israeli civic identity; (2) temporal stability, in which youth whose pre-contact narrative was already characterized by Palestinian identity accentuation maintained that configuration; and (3) life at the hyphen, in which youth actively struggled with and vacillated between states of conflict and integration of their disparate identities.},

Background: To date, reviews of trust in HRI have been qualitative or descriptive. Our quantitative review provides a fundamental empirical foundation to advance both theory and practice. Method: Meta-analytic methods were applied to the available literature on trust and HRI. A total of 29 empirical studies were collected, of which 10 met the selection criteria for correlational analysis and 11 for experimental analysis. These studies provided 69 correlational and 47 experimental effect sizes. Results: The overall correlational effect size for trust was r-- = +0.26,with an experimental effect size of d-- = +0.71. The effects of human, robot, and environmental characteristics were examined with an especial evaluation of the robot dimensions of performance and attribute-based factors. The robot performance and attributes were the largest contributors to the development of trust in HRI. Environmental factors played only a moderate role. Conclusion: Factors related to the robot itself, specifically, its performance, had the greatest current association with trust, and environmental factors were moderately associated. There was little evidence for effects of human-related factors.},

  abstract = {The claim that the settlements in the West Bank are gated communities might seem trivial. Those settlements are an explicit example of a community featuring, on the one hand, social cohesion based on shared values, while, on the other hand, self-isolation with the help of fences and a stress on the `security of the community'. The argument of this paper, however, is different. The paper suggests that the settlement layout in the West Bank is not just an aggregate of 124 `legal' gated communities and a similar number of `illegal outposts', but rather a single, contiguous gated community gating, in turn, Palestinian `islands' within it. The reading I will offer seeks to look at the space in question through a careful reading of its use values. The emphasis is put on the question of mobilities in order to show how the fortressed points turn into an exclusionary web by means of separated roads and movement restrictions. By analysing the combined system of settlements, roads, military legislation, spatial design and applied violence, the paper shows how the few hundred points consolidate into one coherent spatial system. The paper wishes to contribute to the spatial analysis of the now 45-year-old Israeli occupation of the West Bank, to the growing study of politics of mobility and to the discourse of gated communities by adding colonialism and violence to the mostly neoliberal explanations of the phenomenon.},

Even if this has many advantages, people's opinions can be much richer. We argue for assessing them using different methods, including open-ended questions. Manual coding of open-ended answers requires much effort, but automated tools help to analyze them more easily. In order to investigate how attitudes towards outgroups can be assessed and analyzed with different methods, we carried out two representative surveys in Poland. We asked closed- and open-ended questions about what Poland should do regarding the influx of refugees. While the attitudes measured with closed-ended questions were rather negative, those that emerged from open-ended answers were not only richer, but also more positive. Many themes that emerged in the manual coding were also identified in automated text analyses with Meaning Extraction Helper (MEH). Using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) and Sentiment Analyzer from the Common Language Resources and Technology Infrastructure (CLARIN), we compared the difference between the studies in the emotional tone of the answers. Our research confirms the high usefulness of open-ended questions in surveys and shows how methods of textual data analysis help in understanding people's attitudes towards outgroup members. Based on our methods comparison, researchers can choose a method or combine methods in a way that best fits their needs.},

However, despite scientific evidence, there is still strong scepticism surrounding the use of robots in some social fields, such as personal care and education. (2) Methods: in this research, we present a new tool named the HANCON model, which was developed merging and extending the constructs of two solid and proven models---the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model used to examine the factors that may influence the decision to use a telepresence robot as an instrument in educational practice, and the Post Acceptance Model used to evaluate acceptability after the actual use of a telepresence robot. The new tool is implemented and used to study the acceptance of a double telepresence robot by 112 pre-service teachers in an educational setting. (3) Results: the analysis of the experimental results predicts and demonstrate a positive attitude towards the use of telepresence robot in a school setting and confirm the applicability of the model in an educational context.

This is not the case for the "agential realism" of Karen Barad, one of whose features is the view that entities emerge from their interactions rather than pre-existing them. This aspect of Barad's thought puts her at odds with the more traditional concept of realism found among the speculative realists. Yet Barad also rejects Descartes old taxonomical view that there must be two different kinds of entity: thought and dead matter. In abolishing this distinction, Barad is an ally of object-oriented philosophy even while opposing other forms of speculative realism. The second half of the essay criticizes Barad for conflating two entirely different senses of the word "atomism," leading to difficult consequences for her philosophy.},

  abstract = {Participatory Design (PD) is envisioned as an approach to democratizing innovation in the design process by shifting the power dynamics between researcher and participant. Recent scholarship in HCI and design has analyzed the ways collaborative design engagements, such as PD situated in the design workshop can amplify voices and empower underserved populations. Yet, we argue that PD as instantiated in the design workshop is very much an affluent and privileged activity that often neglects the challenges associated with envisioning equitable design solutions among underserved populations. Based on two series of community-based PD workshops with underserved populations in the U.S., we highlight key areas of tension and considerations for a more equitable PD approach: historical context of the research environment, community access, perceptions of materials and activities, and unintentional harm in collecting full accounts of personal narratives. By reflecting on these tensions as a call-to-action, we hope to deconstruct the privilege of the PD workshop within HCI and re-center the focus of design on individuals who are historically underserved.},

  abstract = {This article presents a new framework for understanding research on the intersection between language, communication, and intergroup contact. Contact theory has described a variety of ways in which contact between groups can reduce prejudice and improve intergroup relations. However, the field has become fragmented by the study of a variety of forms of contact whose interconnections have not been elucidated, and it has paid insufficient attention to the language and communicative dynamics of the contact event itself. This article accounts for the variation in forms of contact studied by arraying them in two-dimensional space organized by (a) involvement of self in contact and (b) richness of self-outgroup experience. The former pertains to whether an individual is directly involved in interaction with an outgroup member (vs. merely observing such contact); the latter pertains to the multiplicity of channels and senses through which one experiences the outgroup member.These two dimensions are argued to be largely orthogonal. The two-dimensional space is used to organize mediators and moderators in the field, to specify in detail the intersection between contact and issues of language and communication, as well as to outline areas of particular promise for specific contact interventions.},

We compare mediated vicarious contact with observing only members of the outgroup (parasocial contact), and examine whether the activity of the portrayed contact matters. Building on theory, we predict that watching outgroup members playing music should reduce prejudice more than watching them engaged in nonmusical activities, particularly with vicarious (vs. parasocial) contact. Results show that vicarious musical contact enhances perceptions of synchronization, liking, and honesty between ingroup and outgroup actors in a video, which in turn results in more positive attitudes toward the outgroup. Counter to predictions, parasocial musical contact results in less positive outcomes than parasocial nonimusical contact.},

Therefore, becoming addressee is previous step to become speaker and take turns. In order to make remote participant become addressee, proposed system recognized remote participant's non-verbal cues such as attention directions, nod motions and backchannels.

A virtual human representing an outgroup member (a Palestinian) interacted with 60 Jewish Israeli participants in an experimental study. We manipulated postural mimicry by the virtual interaction partner during a conversation about a sensitive conflict issue. Mimicry increased empathy toward the Palestinians, irrespective of participants' feelings toward the Palestinians prior to the experiment. Further, mimicked participants who reported a priori negative feelings toward Palestinians expressed more sympathy toward their Palestinian virtual interaction partner, rated themselves as closer to him, and perceived the interaction as more harmonious compared to participants in a counter-mimicry condition. The results underscore the impact of mimicry on intergroup interactions, especially on individuals who harbor negative feelings toward the outgroup. The use of virtual--human interactions in obtaining this effect reveals the still widely unexplored potential of technology-enhanced conflict resolution.},

Such meaningful social changes are often driven by young people. But do young people living in contexts of long-term conflicts believe that change is even possible? In a series of six studies (Ntotal\,=\,119,671) over two decades and across two unrelated intractable conflicts in Israel/Palestine and Cyprus, we found that younger (compared to older) generations from both respective rival groups have less hope for peace, and consequently less conciliatory attitudes. We also show that this gradual improvement of peace-promoting emotions and attitudes with increasing age can be experimentally accelerated in young people through a virtual reality-based aging simulation. These findings provide a new perspective on the fundamental question of why long-term conflicts are so difficult to resolve and highlight the importance of instilling hope in young generations to advance peace processes.},

Conversely, positive contact is associated with increased support for social change toward equality among advantaged group members. This raises the important question of under which circumstances intergroup contact can encourage support for social change among both disadvantaged and advantaged groups. In this theoretical article, we tackle this question by introducing a new Integrated ContactCollective Action Model (ICCAM). We first provide an upto-date review of how intergroup contact may promote or hinder social change for both disadvantaged and advantaged groups. We, then, use ICCAM to examine when the many forms of intergroup contact promote or hinder support for social change, proposing the existence of two different paths for disadvantaged and advantaged group members. Finally, we discuss the implications of the model for social intervention and make policy recommendations stemming from a review of available evidence.},

Recent work, however, suggests that intergroup contact can undermine support for social change towards greater equality, especially among disadvantaged group members. Using a large and heterogeneous dataset (12,997 individuals from 69 countries), we demonstrate that intergroup contact and support for social change towards greater equality are positively associated among members of advantaged groups (ethnic majorities and cis-heterosexuals) but negatively associated among disadvantaged groups (ethnic minorities and sexual and gender minorities). Specification-curve analysis revealed important variation in the size---and at times, direction---of correlations, depending on how contact and support for social change were measured. This allowed us to identify one type of support for change---willingness to work in solidarity--- that is positively associated with intergroup contact among both advantaged and disadvantaged group members.},

  abstract = {What role does intergroup contact play in promoting support for social change toward greater social equality? Drawing on the needs-based model of reconciliation, we theorized that when inequality between groups is perceived as illegitimate, disadvantaged group members will experience a need for empowerment and advantaged group members a need for acceptance. When intergroup contact satisfies each group's needs, it should result in more mutual support for social change. Using four sets of survey data collected through the Zurich Intergroup Project in 23 countries, we tested several preregistered predictions, derived from the above reasoning, across a large variety of operationalizations. Two studies of disadvantaged groups (Ns = 689 ethnic minority members in Study 1 and 3,382 sexual/gender minorities in Study 2) support the hypothesis that, after accounting for the effects of intergroup contact and perceived illegitimacy, satisfying the need for empowerment (but not acceptance) during contact is positively related to support for social change. Two studies with advantaged groups (Ns = 2,937 ethnic majority members in Study 3 and 4,203 cis-heterosexual individuals in Study 4) showed that, after accounting for illegitimacy and intergroup contact, satisfying the need for acceptance (but also empowerment) is positively related to support for social change. Overall, findings suggest that intergroup contact is compatible with efforts to promote social change when group-specific needs are met. Thus, to encourage support for social change among both disadvantaged and advantaged group members, it is essential that, besides promoting mutual acceptance, intergroup contact interventions also give voice to and empower members of disadvantaged groups.

In two studies, Jewish-Israelis watched a 360{$^\circ$} VR scene depicting an Israeli-Palestinian confrontation from different POVs--outgroup's, ingroup's while imagining outgroup perspective or ingroup's without imagined perspective-taking. Participants immersed in the outgroup's POV, but not those who imagined the outgroup's perspective, perceived the Palestinians more positively than those immersed in the ingroup's POV. Moreover, participants in the outgroup's POV perceived the Palestinian population in general more favorably and judged a real-life ingroup transgression more strictly than those in the ingroup's POV, even five months after VR intervention. Results suggest that VR can promote conflict resolution by enabling effective perspective-taking.},

  abstract = {Alongside the growing interest within HCI, and arguably computing more generally, in conducting research that has substantial societal benefits, there is a need for new ways to think about and to articulate the challenges of these engaged research projects as well as their results. Action Research (AR) is a class of methods and approaches for conducting democratic and collaborative research with community partners. AR has evolved over the last several decades and offers HCI researchers theoretical lenses, methodological approaches, and pragmatic guidance for conducting socially relevant, collaborative, and engaged research. In this article, I describe the historical context and origins of AR, the scientifically rigorous practice of conducting and evaluating AR projects, and the ways in which AR might meaningfully be applied to HCI research.},

However, ideals of activism, citizen engagement and democratisation through the co-design of networked technologies and services have been largely based on an understanding of urban space as separate from nature, and for human inhabitants alone. In current conditions of climate change, pollution, and loss of biodiversity, a human-centred perspective of cities is increasingly problematic. This workshop focuses on an expanded more-than-human perspective for cities, informed by studies in the Anthropocene in fields such as STS, geography, planning and design. We will interrogate how more-than-human perspectives and their resultant ethical, legal, and methodological concerns can shape participatory design practices and policies towards cohabitation, and push forward a cultural change in the agenda of sustainable smart cities, urban informatics, IoT, and design.},

  abstract = {Early detection of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and other neurological conditions is vital for effective treatment. Existing methods of detecting RA rely on observation, questionnaires, and physical measurement, each with their own weaknesses. Pharmaceutical medications and procedures aim to reduce the debilitating effect, preventing the progression of the illness and bringing the condition into remission. There is still a great deal of ambiguity around patient diagnosis, as the difficulty of measurement has reduced the importance that joint stiffness plays as an RA identifier. The research areas of medical rehabilitation and clinical assessment indicate high impact applications for wearable sensing devices. As a result, the overall aim of this research is to review current sensor technologies that could be used to measure an individual's RA severity. Other research teams within RA have previously developed objective measuring devices to assess the physical symptoms of hand steadiness through to joint stiffness. Unfamiliar physical effects of these sensory devices restricted their introduction into clinical practice. This paper provides an updated review among the sensor and glove types proposed in the literature to assist with the diagnosis and rehabilitation activities of RA. Consequently, the main goal of this paper is to review contact systems and to outline their potentialities and limitations. Considerable attention has been paid to gloved based devices as they have been extensively researched for medical practice in recent years. Such technologies are reviewed to determine whether they are suitable measuring tools.},

  abstract = {Virtual Reality (VR) has been increasingly referred to as the ``ultimate empathy machine'' since it allows users to experience any situation from any point of view. However, empirical evidence supporting the claim that VR is a more effective method of eliciting empathy than traditional perspective-taking is limited. Two experiments were conducted in order to compare the short and long-term effects of a traditional perspective-taking task and a VR perspective-taking task (Study 1), and to explore the role of technological immersion when it comes to different types of mediated perspective-taking tasks (Study 2). Results of Study 1 show that over the course of eight weeks participants in both conditions reported feeling empathetic and connected to the homeless at similar rates, however, participants who became homeless in VR had more positive, longer-lasting attitudes toward the homeless and signed a petition supporting the homeless at a significantly higher rate than participants who performed a traditional perspective-taking task. Study 2 compared three different types of perspective-taking tasks with different levels of immersion (traditional vs. desktop computer vs. VR) and a control condition (where participants received fact-driven information about the homeless). Results show that participants who performed any type of perspective-taking task reported feeling more empathetic and connected to the homeless than the participants who only received information. Replicating the results from Study 1, there was no difference in self-report measures for any of the perspective-taking conditions, however, a significantly higher number of participants in the VR condition signed a petition supporting affordable housing for the homeless compared to the traditional and less immersive conditions. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings.},

  abstract = {In keeping with the focus of this special section, we concentrate initially on some of the problems of autonomist Marxist concepts such as `immaterial labour', `affective labour' and `precarity' for understanding work in the cultural industries. We then briefly review some relevant media theory (John Thompson's notion of mediated quasi-interaction) and some key recent sociological research on cultural labour (especially work by Andrew Ross and Laura Grindstaff, the latter drawing on Hochschild's concept of emotional labour), which we believe may be more useful than autonomist concepts in developing empirically informed critique. The main body of the article then consists of an ethnographic account of working on one particular television programme, an account that aims to build on these theoretical debates. We analyse how the power to provide exposure or not to individuals in the talent show genre in contemporary television (a feature that derives from the symbolic power of producers to make texts that are then circulated to massive numbers of people) and disputes between commissioners and independent producers about how best to go about doing so (an organizational issue) are registered in the form of stress, anxiety and sometimes poor working relations among project teams of young television researchers (a matter of working conditions and experiences). We especially focus on how additional pressures are borne by these workers because of the requirements to undertake emotional labour, involving the handling of strong emotions on the part of talent show contributors, and to maintain good working relations in short-term project work, requirements generated by the need to ensure future employment. Ultimately, then, we support the view that creative work is `precarious' -- but we go beyond the generalizations involved in concepts such as immaterial labour and affective labour to show the specific ways in which precariousness is registered and negotiated in the lives of young workers in one industry.},

We build on the concepts of lifeworld and systems, developed in Habermas' theory of communicative action. The discussion is supported and enriched by the work of Feenberg and van Dijck, integrating insights from Science and Technology Studies and media studies. Technology philosopher and critical Science and Technology Studies scholar Feenberg introduces technology as a steering ``medium'' that delinguistifies and possibly colonizes the lifeworld by reinterpreting media sociological perspectives of Habermas, Marcuse, Latour, and Callon. In a similar way, media scholar van Dijck analyses the transition from human connectedness to automated connectivity in the context of social media. We then illustrate the delinguistification and the colonization of lifeworld with a systematic analysis of the contingent evolution of Facebook as one particular case in social media. We focus on three specific artifacts in Facebook, framed as obligatory passage points: EdgeRank, Sponsored Stories, and Gatekeeper. Each of them gives an idea how the private space is subsumed under the commercial space and how the colonization reconfigures the public space in social media like Facebook. In this sense, we complement the political economy analysis of prosumer commodity with the action-theoretical autonomist approach of immaterial labor, highlighting new potential threats of the current social media development.},

  abstract = {Pneumatic artificial muscles have some advantages. Especially, the flexibility of artificial muscles contributes to compose novel mechanisms. The flexibility of pneumatic artificial muscles releases us from the spatially strict design that is necessary for rigid mechanical mechanisms. It could actualize compact mechanisms consisting of fewer components. The thin McKibben muscles are more flexible than conventional McKibben muscles. Authors succeeded in manufacturing novel soft mechanisms that are composed of only woven artificial muscles and strings. We called this mechanism active textile. The structure is uniformed with woven artificial muscles; nevertheless, the forms and movements of mechanisms are diverse. We aim to establish a design method for these active textiles. Thus, we should know how the expansion of muscles affects the behavior of mechanisms. We reported that deformations of active textiles are changed by woven structures. In addition to that, wefts' characteristics such as cross-sectional shape, bending stiffness and elasticity determine the characteristic of a textile. Deformations of active textiles are caused by the contraction and the expansion of thin McKibben muscles. In this paper, authors focus the contraction in the wefts direction of active textile that is caused by the expansion of thin McKibben muscles as warps. We fabricated three different active textiles that made of thin McKibben muscle and three different strings. We observed experimentally the contraction behavior in the weft direction of active textiles: the contraction characteristics the relationship between applied pressure and contraction ratio and the relationship between applied pressure and contraction force. As result, the contraction characteristics of active textiles are changed by using different strings as wefts. Maximum contraction force is caused by using thin strings, and the hysteresis of the active textile that made of elastic strings is small.},

In the present investigation, interpersonal-disgust sensitivity (e.g., not wanting to wear clean used clothes or to sit on a warm seat vacated by a stranger) in particular predicted negative attitudes toward immigrants, foreigners, and socially deviant groups, even after controlling for concerns with contracting disease. The mechanisms underlying the link between interpersonal disgust and attitudes toward immigrants were explored using a path model. As predicted, the effect of interpersonaldisgust sensitivity on group attitudes was indirect, mediated by ideological orientations (social dominance orientation, right-wing authoritarianism) and dehumanizing perceptions of the out-group. The effects of social dominance orientation on group attitudes were both direct and indirect, via dehumanization. These results establish a link between disgust sensitivity and prejudice that is not accounted for by fear of infection, but rather is mediated by ideological orientations and dehumanizing group representations. Implications for understanding and reducing prejudice are discussed.},

  abstract = {We present the design, implementation, and evaluation of a peripheral empathy-evoking robotic conversation companion, Kip1. The robot's function is to increase people's awareness to the effect of their behavior towards others, potentially leading to behavior change. Specifically, Kip1 is designed to promote nonaggressive conversation between people. It monitors the conversation's nonverbal aspects and maintains an emotional model of its reaction to the conversation. If the conversation seems calm, Kip1 responds by a gesture designed to communicate curious interest. If the conversation seems aggressive, Kip1 responds by a gesture designed to communicate fear. We describe the design process of Kip1, guided by the principles of peripheral and evocative. We detail its hardware and software systems, and a study evaluating the effects of the robot's autonomous behavior on couples' conversations. We find support for our design goals. A conversation companion reacting to the conversation led to more gaze attention, but not more verbal distraction, compared to a robot that moves but does not react to the conversation. This suggests that robotic devices could be designed as companions to-human-human interaction without compromising the natural communication flow between people. Participants also rated the reacting robot as having significantly more social human character traits and as being significantly more similar to them. This points to the robot's potential to elicit people's empathy.},

As people are highly sensitive to physical movement and spatiotemporal affordances, well-designed robot motion can communicate, engage, and offer dynamic possibilities beyond the machines' surface appearance or pragmatic motion paths. We present techniques for movement centric design, including character animation sketches, video prototyping, interactive movement explorations, Wizard of Oz studies, and skeletal prototypes. To illustrate our design approach, we discuss four case studies: a social head for a robotic musician, a robotic speaker dock listening companion, a desktop telepresence robot, and a service robot performing assistive and communicative tasks. We then relate our approach to the design of non-anthropomorphic robots and robotic objects, a design strategy that could facilitate the feasibility of real-world human-robot interaction.},

In my analysis, I contextualise PewDiePie's own comments and YouTube's publications into the history of Internet culture and introduce the development of YouTube into a neoliberalist sphere. I illustrate how neoliberal ideology is now implemented on three levels on YouTube: through creating an illusion of intimacy between a creator and his/her fans, through the promise of equal opportunity on YouTube and through a neoliberalist interpretation of the marketplace-of-ideas principle. The analysis reveals how YouTube's policies and practices as ideological choices contribute to the normalisation of racism on social media.},

Although existing AI methods have produced powerful applications that outperform humans in specific bounded domains, these techniques have fundamental limitations that hinder the creation of general intelligent systems. In parallel, over the last few decades, an explosion of experimental techniques in neuroscience has significantly increased our understanding of the human brain. This review argues that improvements in current AI using mathematical or logical techniques are unlikely to lead to general AI. Instead, the AI community should incorporate neuroscience discoveries about the neocortex, the human brain's center of intelligence. The article explains the limitations of current AI techniques. It then focuses on the biologically constrained Thousand Brains Theory describing the neocortex's computational principles. Future AI systems can incorporate these principles to overcome the stated limitations of current systems. Finally, the article concludes that AI researchers and neuroscientists should work together on specified topics to achieve biologically constrained AI with human-like capabilities.},

We delineate how the disciplinary context of art both enables and limits the kinds of participation that can be achieved. We characterize 3 strategies these artists use to achieve participation: participation in spectacle, participation in making, and participation in inquiry. We develop the implications of this work to inform HCI through three case studies related to sustainability -- spectacle computing, heirloom computing, and citizen science -- to demonstrate the potential for similar strategies for participation and to call attention to how HCI, too, implicitly constructs, enables, and constrains participation.},

  abstract = {The free energy principle (FEP) has gained widespread interest and growing acceptance as a new paradigm of brain function, but has had little impact on the theory and practice of psychotherapy. The aim of this paper is to redress this. Brains rely on Bayesian inference during which ``bottom-up'' sensations are matched with ``top-down'' predictions. Discrepancies result in ``prediction error.'' The brain abhors informational ``surprise,'' which is minimized by (1) action enhancing the statistical likelihood of sensory samples, (2) revising inferences in the light of experience, updating ``priors'' to reality-aligned ``posteriors,'' and (3) optimizing the complexity of our generative models of a capricious world. In all three, free energy is converted to bound energy. In psychopathology energy either remains unbound, as in trauma and inhibition of agency, or manifests restricted, anachronistic ``top-down'' narratives. Psychotherapy fosters client agency, linguistic and practical. Temporary uncoupling bottom-up from top-down automatism and fostering scrutinized simulations sets a number of salutary processes in train. Mentalising enriches Bayesian inference, enabling experience and feeling states to be ``metabolized'' and assimilated. ``Free association'' enhances more inclusive sensory sampling, while dream analysis foregrounds salient emotional themes as ``attractors.'' FEP parallels with psychoanalytic theory are outlined, including Freud's unpublished project, Bion's ``contact barrier'' concept, the Fonagy/Target model of sexuality, Laplanche's therapist as ``enigmatic signifier,'' and the role of projective identification. The therapy stimulates patients to become aware of and revise the priors' they bring to interpersonal experience. In the therapeutic ``duet for one,'' the energy binding skills and non-partisan stance of the analyst help sufferers face trauma without being overwhelmed by psychic entropy. Overall, the FEP provides a sound theoretical basis for psychotherapy practice, training, and research.},

To examine this transformation this paper surveys participatory art and design projects in a number of different fields and also some of the key critical literature around the aesthetics of collaboration and dialog. Finally it argues that art in the form of participatory design offers a political alternative to both the avant-garde tactic of adversarial ``shock'' and the notion of presenting a voice or an opinion in a neutral public sphere; rather it can be seen to modify -- design -- that sphere itself.},

  abstract = {In Usability and Accessibility Engineering, metric standards are vital. However, the development of a set of reciprocal metrics---which can serve as an extension of, and supplement to, current standards---becomes indispensable when the specific needs of end-user groups, such as the elderly and people with disabilities, are concerned. While ISO 9126 remains critical to the usability of a product, the needs of the elderly population are forcing the integration of other factors. Familiarity and recognisability are not relevant to someone with no experience and therefore no referent; however, acceptance becomes a major factor in their willingness to learn something new and this acceptance requires trust based on association. Readability and legibility are of less relevance to a blind person than to someone with failing eyesight. This paper describes some usability metrics ascertained on the basis of experiments made with applications for elderly people throughout the summer term of 2007. The factors that influence the older users' acceptance of software, including the extent of their previous exposure to technology, are evaluated in order to provide short guidelines for software developers on how to design and develop software for the elderly. The evaluation of the expectations, behavior, abilities, and limitations of prospective end-users is considered of primary importance for the development of technology. A total of N~=~31 participants (22 women/9 men) took part in various tests. The participants' ages ranged from 49 to 96~years with an average age of 79. Five of the tests were designed for a PDA or cellular phone, one test was designed for a laptop PC. Of the total of 55 tests, 52 tests provided sufficient data to evaluate the results. In 23 of the tests, all tasks were completed. As a main outcome, it can be experimentally proved that the acceptance is related to a factor, which is this paper is called PET (Previous Exposure to Technology). This is discussed in light of the aforementioned metrics.},

It then makes recourse, secondly, to a series of concepts in Lacanian psychoanalysis so as to shed light on these dilemmas. Two questions seem to particularly vex Coetzee. Firstly, where should we seek to locate agency in respect of apartheid ideology: predominantly on the side of the subject or predominantly the side of structure? Secondly, if we need to appeal both to subject and structure, then how are we to understand the relation between these two factors in the workings of apartheid ideology? By means of Lacanian conceptualisation, the paper supplements and extends Coetzee's argument according to which the notion of desire is central to understanding the spread and hold of apartheid ideology. The paper then moves on to elaborate a Lacanian understanding of ideological agency which accounts for the relation between subject and structure (or, in Lacanian terms, subject and the symbolic Other) and does so by thinking apartheid as a transaction of desire and/or lack between the two.},

In two simultaneously running loops, a more reflective process is balanced with a more affective process. If human interference is detected behind the machine, Robot-Mediated Communication commences, which basically follows CMC assumptions; if human interference remains undetected, Human-Robot Communication comes into play, holding the robot for an autonomous social actor. The more emotionally aroused a robot user is, the more likely they develop an affective relationship with what actually is a machine. The main contribution of this paper is an integration of Computer-Mediated Communication, Human-Robot Communication, and Media Psychology, outlining a full-blown theory of robot communication connected to friendship formation, accounting for communicative features, modes of processing, as well as psychophysiology.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes an emotion recognition system using a deep learning approach from emotional Big Data. The Big Data comprises of speech and video. In the proposed system, a speech signal is first processed in the frequency domain to obtain a Mel-spectrogram, which can be treated as an image. Then this Mel-spectrogram is fed to a convolutional neural network (CNN). For video signals, some representative frames from a video segment are extracted and fed to the CNN. The outputs of the two CNNs are fused using two consecutive extreme learning machines (ELMs). The output of the fusion is given to a support vector machine (SVM) for final classification of the emotions. The proposed system is evaluated using two audio--visual emotional databases, one of which is Big Data. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed system involving the CNNs and the ELMs.},

Here we present an experiment where every participant was matched with one human and one robot to perform decision-making tasks. By manipulating who has power, we created three conditions: human as leader, robot as leader, and a no-power-diference control. The results showed that the participants were signifcantly more infuenced by the leader, regardless of whether the leader was a human or a robot. However, they generally held a more positive attitude toward the human than the robot, although they considered whichever was in power as more competent. This study illustrates the importance of power for future Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) and Human-AI Interaction (HAI) research, as it addresses pressing concerns of society about AI-powered intelligent agents.},

In silico, data-driven models build, adapt and improve representations of the target system using real-world experimental data. By simulating huge numbers of virtual robots using these data-driven models, optimization algorithms can illuminate multiple design candidates for transference to the real world. In reality, largescale physical experimentation facilitates the fabrication, testing and analysis of multiple candidate designs. Automated assembly and reconfigurable modular systems enable significantly higher numbers of real-world design evaluations than previously possible. Large volumes of ground-truth data gathered via physical experimentation can be returned to the virtual environment to improve data-driven models and guide optimization. Grounding the design process in physical experimentation ensures the complexity of virtual robot designs does not outpace the model limitations or available fabrication technologies. We outline key developments in the design of physically embodied soft robots under the framework of reality-assisted evolution.},

The paper first reviews the main achievements and research of the robot, which were mainly based on the breakthrough of automatic control and hardware in mechanics. With the evolution of artificial intelligence, many pieces of research have made further progresses in adaptive and robust control. The survey reveals that the latest research in deep learning and reinforcement learning has paved the way for highly complex tasks to be performed by robots. Furthermore, deep reinforcement learning, imitation learning, and transfer learning in robot control are discussed in detail. Finally, major achievements based on these methods are summarized and analyzed thoroughly, and future research challenges are proposed.},

Here, we introduce a strategy for additively manufacturing unified soft robots comprising fully integrated fluidic circuitry in a single print run via PolyJet three-dimensional (3D) printing. We explore the efficacy of this approach for soft robots designed to leverage novel 3D fluidic circuit elements---e.g., fluidic diodes, ``normally closed'' transistors, and ``normally open'' transistors with geometrically tunable pressure-gain functionalities---to operate in response to fluidic analogs of conventional electronic signals, including constant-flow [``direct current (DC)''], ``alternating current (AC)''--inspired, and preprogrammed aperiodic (``variable current'') input conditions. By enabling fully integrated soft robotic entities (composed of soft actuators, fluidic circuitry, and body features) to be rapidly disseminated, modified on demand, and 3D-printed in a single run, the presented design and additive manufacturing strategy offers unique promise to catalyze new classes of soft robots. We 3D-print unified soft robots comprising fully integrated fluidic circuitry capable of sophisticated operations.

In this article, I explore this question by drawing on my own experiences of reconsidering essentialist and representationalist assumptions, and becoming a sociomaterial researcher. My exploration draws on my experiences of conducting a qualitative longitudinal case study at the Swedish Migration Board. Specifically, I show what it can mean to `invite materiality' into interviews, examine the conditions of possibility to become in certain ways by tracing the genealogy of practices, and engage with data relationally rather than categorically. By accounting for my experience of working through these practices, I aim to develop and articulate an understanding of what the ontological position underlying a sociomaterial approach implies for epistemology, and of how we can act (or, rather, intra-act) more creatively and responsibly as sociomaterial researchers. Moreover, I highlight differences in the kinds of knowledge that a sociomaterial approach grounded in relational and performative onto-epistemologies, as opposed to a socio-material approach, grounded in critical realism, produce about the unfolding of organizational practices---specifically, the practices unfolding in the reception area of the Swedish Migration Board. The paper contributes to the current debate on sociomaterial approaches, and in particular to the development of practices available to draw upon for researchers taking a sociomaterial approach.},

We show how translation, rather than being reduced to a network of human intentions and actions governing the transformation of organizational practices, can instead be understood as a historically contingent, situated flow of mundane everyday work practices through which social and material translators simultaneously become translated, conditioned to be and act in certain ways. We show how prior actor-centric accounts of translation of management ideas can be understood as performative consequences of a conceptual vocabulary inherited from Callon and Latour. Contrasting this, the non-actor-centric vocabulary of social anthropologist Tim Ingold allows us to background the intentional human actor and foreground the flow of mundane, situated practices. In adopting this vocabulary, we capture how the flow of practices conditions subjects and objects to become enacted as well as act, and develop an understanding of translation as occurring within, rather than distinct from, these practices. In essence, our novel view of translation emphasizes how management ideas are radically unstable, and subject to alteration through the flow of practices rather than as a result of deliberate implementation efforts.},

The major improvement from the previous work is to mount the 9-DOF mechanism, which mimicking a glove puppet manipulation, on a two-wheel mobile platform. The platform provides agile movements of the robot but itself is an unstable system. Hence, a self-balancing controller is implemented by considering the motion as well as configuration variation of the upper body (the 9-DOF mechanism). The control law utilizes the principle of computed torque method with online identification of related parameters using various sensors including an accelerometer. The incline angle is obtained by fusing a gyroscope and a tilt sensor. Under the balancing control, the forward motion of the robot is achieved by giving a desired tilt angle profile. To minimize the footprint of electronics, the controller is implemented using an 8-bit single-chip microcontroller. Further, to enhance the interaction capability of the system, a simple gesture coding using dynamic time warping identification method with Markov model is implemented for the data glove to recognize the puppet gesture by human hand.},

In this system, we augment a 3D volume video of the remote participant over the on-site robot. The robot agent in this system represents a remote user with camera, microphone, and mobility. Using this robot agent, the remote user and the local user can show their appearances and interact with tangible interfaces. This robot agent system can be applied to various tele-meeting applications such as tele-marketing and tele-tutoring. For example, we implemented a tele-marketing system to show the feasibility of the suggested system.},

Both humans and sophisticated AI agents process information about the world in order to achieve goals and obtain rewards, which is why AI can be used as a model of the human brain and mind. This book intends to make the theory accessible to a relatively general audience, requiring only some relevant scientific background. The book starts with the assumption that suffering is mainly caused by frustration. Frustration means the failure of an agent (whether AI or human) to achieve a goal or a reward it wanted or expected. Frustration is inevitable because of the overwhelming complexity of the world, limited computational resources, and scarcity of good data. In particular, such limitations imply that an agent acting in the real world must cope with uncontrollability, unpredictability, and uncertainty, which all lead to frustration.},

  abstract = {Humans, more than any other species, have been altering their paths of development by creating new material forms and by opening up to new possibilities of material engagement. That is, we become constituted through making and using technologies that shape our minds and extend our bodies. We make things which in turn make us. This ongoing dialectic has long been recognised from a deep-time perspective. It also seems natural in the present in view of the ways new materialities and digital ecologies increasingly envelop our everyday life and thinking. Still the basic idea that humans and things are co-constituted continues to challenge us, raising important questions about the place and meaning of materiality and technical change in human life and evolution. This paper bridging perspectives from postphenomenology and Material Engagement Theory (MET) is trying to attain better understanding about these matters. Our emphasis falls specifically on the human predisposition for technological embodiment and creativity. We re-approach the notion Homo faber in a way that, on the one hand, retains the power and value of this notion to signify the primacy of making or creative material engagement in human life and evolution and, on the other hand, reclaims the notion from any misleading connotations of human exceptionalism (other animals make and use tools). In particular, our use of the term Homo faber refers to the special place that this ability has in the evolution and development of our species. The difference that makes the difference is not just the fact that we make things. The difference that makes the difference is the recursive effect that the things that we make and our skills of making seem to have on human becoming. We argue that we are Homo faber not just because we make things but also because we are made by them.},

  abstract = {Material Engagement Theory (MET) is currently driving a conceptual change in the archaeology of mind. Drawing upon the dictates of enactivism and active externalism, it specifically calls for a radical reconceptualization of mind and material culture. Unpersuaded by the common assumption that cognition is brain-bound, Malafouris argues in favour of a process ontology that situates thinking in action. In granting ontological primacy to material engagement, MET seeks to illuminate the emergence of human ways of thinking through the practical effects of the material world. Considering that this is a characteristic example of a pragmatic take on cognition, this contemporary theoretical platform appears to share a lot with pragmatism. As of late, scholars working at the intersection of philosophy, semiotics, and cognitive science have made important steps towards the rapprochement between pragmatism and externalism. Looking to contribute to this growing corpus of work, the present paper focuses on MET's relation to the pragmatism of Peirce, Dewey, and Mead. Having elsewhere recognized the overlap and complementarity between Malafouris' and Peirce's theories in particular, I developed a pragmatic and enactive theory of cognitive semiotics that is suitably geared to trace the nature, emergence, and evolution of material signs. Therefore, besides noting some obvious historical connections, I hereby aim to establish (at least part of) the theoretical backdrop upon which this composite theory is supposed to function, while also exploring new potential avenues. Given that this cognitive semiotic framework can be seen as a pragmatic extension of Malafouris' enactivist approach to archaeology, the current paper delves into MET's theoretical underpinnings, seeking to complement its working hypotheses and concepts with philosophical notions and ideas advanced long ago. This synthesis ultimately concludes with a call for the reconceptualization of `representation' as a heuristic concept.},

Assuming that the virtual environment fits Allport boundary conditions for effective contact that reduces prejudice, we undertook this meta-analysis. Our aim was to demonstrate that online intergroup contact is a successful means of improving intergroup relations. Results from 23 studies (20 journal articles and 3 unpublished records) showed that the effect is significant. Effect size was independent of the characteristics of samples, including their countries. There were stronger effects when the induced contact focused on cooperation but not for support of the interaction by an authority figure or the presence of common goals.},

Building on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and social neuroscience models we developed an eight-week dialogue group-intervention for youth growing up amidst intractable conflict. Eighty-eight Israeli-Jewish and Arab-Palestinian adolescents (16-18years) were randomly assigned to intervention or control groups. Before (T1) and after (T2) intervention, one-on-one conflict interaction with outgroup member were videotaped, oxytocin levels assayed, attitudes self-reported, and youth interviewed regarding national conflict. We tested the hypothesis that dialogue intervention would enhance empathic behavior and increase oxytocin levels following interaction with outgroup member. Intervention increased youth perspective-taking on national conflict. Oxytocin increased from T1 to T2 only for adolescents undergoing intervention who improved perspective taking in the process. Structural equation modelling charted three pathways to behavioral empathy toward outgroup member at T2; via endogenous oxytocin, empathic cognitions, and dialogue intervention; however, an alternative model without the intervention arm was non-significant. Our findings highlight the important role of empathy in programs for inter-group reconciliation and support evolutionary models on the precarious balance between the neurobiology of affiliation and the neurobiology of outgroup derogation.},

Anthropology, by contrast, is an inquiry into the conditions and possibilities of human life in the world. Anthropology and ethnography may have much to contribute to one another, but their aims and objectives are different. Ethnography is an end in itself; it is not a means to anthropological ends. Moreover, participant observation is an anthropological way of working, not a method of ethnographic data collection. To study anthropology is to study with people, not to make studies of them; such study is not so much ethnographic as educational. An anthropological education gives us the intellectual means to speculate on the conditions of human life in this world, without our having to pretend that our arguments are distillations of the practical wisdom of those among whom we have worked. Our job is to correspond with them, not to speak for them. Only by acknowledging the speculative nature of anthropological inquiry can we both make our voices heard and properly engage with other disciplines. And only then can we lead the way in forging the universities of the future.},

  abstract = {Indirect forms of intergroup contact, such as extended and vicarious contact, are thought to provide a promising alternative to direct contact, but very few studies have compared the effectiveness of these two types of contact to confirm this claim. Furthermore, Wright, Aron, McLaughlin-Volpe, and Ropp (1997) postulated, but did not test, that the usefulness of extended (or vicarious) over direct contact lies in these forms of indirect contact being likely to elicit less anxiety and more group salience at the time of the interaction, both of which are beneficial for contact. The present paper reports two experiments comparing the effects of direct and vicarious contact on: (i) outgroup attitudes and anxiety for future contact both immediately after contact (posttest) as well as a week later (delayed posttest), and (ii) their elicited interaction-induced anxiety and group salience. Both studies were conducted in Cyprus, with Greek Cypriot participants and the Turkish Cypriot community as the outgroup. Results did not support Wright et al.'s postulations. They furthermore showed that direct contact had a relative advantage over vicarious contact in leading to more positive outgroup attitudes at posttest, but that attitudes reverted to pretest levels for both conditions at delayed posttest. Vicarious, unlike direct, contact, did, however, lead to a persistent reduction of anxiety for future contact, thus suggesting that the greatest utility of indirect forms of contact may lie in their emotionally preparing individuals for subsequent face-to-face interactions.},

This study identified as weaknesses of our system: the hand tracking unreliability and the lack of tactile feedback, causing discomfort in experienced puppeteering professionals.

In contrast with the recent claim of Thomas Everth and Laura Gurney (2022), this paper argues that decoherence supports rather than defeats the holist, relational ontology of agential realism. Indeed, decoherence offers an explanation for how a quantum system can remain entangled and superposed in principle while it nevertheless in practice appears classical to a local observer. Decoherence shows why the appearance of classicality is not an objection to the ontology being in reality that of agential realism, in accordance with Barad's repeated insistence that we should not mistake principle for practice.

  abstract = {In the context of the current war, the question ``Is the Israeli state effecting genocide in Gaza?'' suggests a threshold legal excursus, a definitional contestation, or a cry of moral outrage. This article does not take any of those paths. It lives the pain of the unethical deaths of tens of thousands of civilians in Gaza, while beginning the longer-term task of seeking a way beyond deploying the concept of ``genocide'' as a performative gesture of shock and horror. The article argues that the meaning of genocide is being emptied out by an unsettling of the grounding conditions of political debate and the relativization of political language. While the evidence is strong that crimes against humanity are being perpetrated in Gaza, both by the Israeli state in its attack upon civilians and by Hamas in holding hostages, the provisional ruling by the International Court of Justice that there is a case to be answered is the most resolute that we can be at this point. Clearly, the war has to stop. In the meantime, the article suggests an alternative way of naming the horror.},

While schools of thought differ significantly in how they position themselves vis-{\`a}-vis the subjectivist-objectivist axis, few would deny that the delineation of the interpretive task must attend to the embodied character of human cognition. Taking such a broader framework as a starting point, I will tackle a specific aspect of this problematic by examining Foucault's conception of subjectivity and truth as it relates to issues of epistemology, moral responsibility, and ask{\=e}sis. As I will argue, Foucault's ``art of living'' persuasively highlights the background or ``unthought'' aspects of hermeneutics. My particular approach will be to connect Foucault's brand of virtue epistemology with a broadly post-Heideggerian conception of engaged agency, and in so doing spotlight some assumptions as to what ``having truth'' or ``arriving at it'' might mean in the context of hermeneutical practice and being.},

  abstract = {Commonsense Norm Bank is presented, a moral textbook customized for machines, which compiles 1.7M examples of people's ethical judgments on a broad spectrum of everyday situations, showing strong promise of language-based commonsense moral reasoning. What would it take to teach a machine to behave ethically? While broad ethical rules may seem straightforward to state ("thou shalt not kill"), applying such rules to real-world situations is far more complex. For example, while"helping a friend"is generally a good thing to do,"helping a friend spread fake news"is not. We identify four underlying challenges towards machine ethics and norms: (1) an understanding of moral precepts and social norms; (2) the ability to perceive real-world situations visually or by reading natural language descriptions; (3) commonsense reasoning to anticipate the outcome of alternative actions in different contexts; (4) most importantly, the ability to make ethical judgments given the interplay between competing values and their grounding in different contexts (e.g., the right to freedom of expression vs. preventing the spread of fake news). Our paper begins to address these questions within the deep learning paradigm. Our prototype model, Delphi, demonstrates strong promise of language-based commonsense moral reasoning, with up to 92.1\% accuracy vetted by humans. This is in stark contrast to the zero-shot performance of GPT-3 of 52.3\%, which suggests that massive scale alone does not endow pre-trained neural language models with human values. Thus, we present Commonsense Norm Bank, a moral textbook customized for machines, which compiles 1.7M examples of people's ethical judgments on a broad spectrum of everyday situations. In addition to the new resources and baseline performances for future research, our study provides new insights that lead to several important open research questions: differentiating between universal human values and personal values, modeling different moral frameworks, and explainable, consistent approaches to machine ethics.},

Our system consists of three independently trained components: (1) a speaker encoder network, trained on a speaker verification task using an independent dataset of noisy speech without transcripts from thousands of speakers, to generate a fixed-dimensional embedding vector from only seconds of reference speech from a target speaker; (2) a sequence-to-sequence synthesis network based on Tacotron 2 that generates a mel spectrogram from text, conditioned on the speaker embedding; (3) an auto-regressive WaveNet-based vocoder network that converts the mel spectrogram into time domain waveform samples. We demonstrate that the proposed model is able to transfer the knowledge of speaker variability learned by the discriminatively-trained speaker encoder to the multispeaker TTS task, and is able to synthesize natural speech from speakers unseen during training. We quantify the importance of training the speaker encoder on a large and diverse speaker set in order to obtain the best generalization performance. Finally, we show that randomly sampled speaker embeddings can be used to synthesize speech in the voice of novel speakers dissimilar from those used in training, indicating that the model has learned a high quality speaker representation.},

A key feature of the Wii is its motion-sensing capability that empowers players to manipulate and interact with items on-screen via movement. The present study examined the effects of video game players' self-construal on parasocial interaction with their avatars and feelings of self-presence. In this study, parasocial interaction was operationally defined as the extent of game players' interpersonal involvement with their avatar and the extent to which game players perceive themselves as interacting with the avatar. Self-presence was defined as the degree to which video game players feel as if their avatar on the screen were their real self. Based on an experiment, the study discovered that game players with high interdependent self-construal showed closer parasocial interaction and higher level of self-presence than those with low interdependent self-construal. Results also showed that self-presence mediated the effects of interdependent self-construal on the parasocial relationship with game players' avatars. Thus, the study discovered an important individual difference factor, interdependent self-construal, affecting the degree to which people form a parasocial relationship with their virtual self that is visually manifested in the form of an avatar. In addition, the present study added empirical evidence about the mediating role played by self-presence in avatar-based video games.},

  abstract = {This chapter outlines the design of software for embedded control of robotic marionettes using choreography. In traditional marionette puppetry, the puppets often possess dynamics that are quite different from the creatures they imitate. Puppeteers must therefore understand and leverage the inherent dynamics of the puppets to create believable and expressive characters. Because marionettes are actuated by strings, the mechanical description of the marionettes either creates a multiscale or degenerate system---making simulation of the constrained dynamics challenging. Moreover, marionettes have 40--50~degrees of freedom with closed kinematic chains. Generating puppet choreography that is mimetic (that is, recognizably human) results in a high-dimensional nonlinear optimal control problem that must be solved for each motion. In performance, these motion primitives must be combined in a way that preserves stability, resulting in an optimal timing control problem. Our software accounts for the efficient computation of the (1) discrete time dynamics that preserve the constraints and other integrals of motion, (2) nonlinear optimal control policies (including optimal control of LTV systems), and (3) optimal timing of choreography, all within a single framework. We discuss our current results and the potential application of our findings across disciplines, including the development of entertainment robots and autonomous theater.},

We also find that flaming is associated with anger directed toward a negotiator's partner, which can occur when a negotiator perceives that the partner is being unfair. We find further that anger totally mediates the relationships between flaming and its antecedents. These findings provide the basis to argue that anger reduction can effectively decrease flaming, independent of the existence of flaming antecedents, such as unfairness. We therefore provide suggestions that can help with the reduction of anger in such circumstances.},

Lastly, the study revealed that hard skill disciplines, when they migrate to technology-mediated environments, are more likely to fail to achieve their educational goals than soft skill disciplines subject to the same migration.},

It is commonly presumed that soft robots are perceived as more natural, and thus more appealing, than rigid robots, an assumption that has not hitherto been tested or validated. This study investigates human perception of and physical interaction with soft robots as compared with rigid robots. Using a mixed-methods approach, we conducted an observational study to explore whether soft robots are perceived as more natural, and what types of interactions soft robots encourage. In a between-subjects study, participants interacted with a soft robotic tentacle or a rigid robot of a similar shape. The interactions were video recorded, and data was also obtained from questionnaires (Nvideo\,=\,123, Nquest\,=\,94). Despite their drastically different appearances and materials, we found no significant differences in how appealing or natural the robots were rated to be. Appeal was positively associated with perceived naturalness in all cases, however we observed a wide variation in how participants define ``natural''. Although participants showed no clear preference, qualitative analysis of video data indicated that soft robots and rigid robots elicit different interaction patterns and behaviors. The findings highlight the key role of physical embodiment and materiality in human--robot interaction, and challenge existing assumptions about what makes robots appear natural.},

Negative effects were enhanced among people who identified more strongly with the U.S. citizen character, and positive effects were moderately, although nonsignificantly enhanced among those who viewed the illegal immigrant character as more typical of illegal immigrants in general. Liking of the illegal immigrant character was a significant mediator of the effects. The positive effects on attitudes toward illegal immigrants transferred to more positive attitudes toward other social groups as well.

The present study aims to develop a beaming system that provide a full-body ownership through a humanoid robot, and investigate users' telecommunication experiences as roles of visitor and local with different levels of controllability. Forty participants were assigned to both visitor and local roles, and their copresence, usability, eye-contact, emotion, verbal, and gesture communications were investigated. The results suggested that the subjective reports on the telecommunication experience of the visitors were generally controlled in a stepwise manner depending on the level of embodiment controllability, whereas that of the locals were not. However, participants' emotion, verbal, and gesture communications showed synchronizing tendencies between the visitor and the local. The implications of these results for future physical beaming systems are discussed.},

In a 2 (negative trigger: task- directed vs. personal attack) x 2 (repair: yes vs. no) between- subjects experiment (N = 57 teams, 114 participants), we studied the effect of a robot intervention on affect, perceptions of conflict, perceptions of team members' contributions, and team performance during a problem-solving task. Specifically, the robot either intervened by repairing a task-directed or personal attack by a confederate or did not intervene. Contrary to our expectations, we found that the robot's repair interventions increased the groups' awareness of conflict after the occurrence of a personal attack thereby acting against the groups' tendency to suppress the conflict. These findings suggest that repair heightened awareness of a normative violation. Overall, our results provide support for the idea that robots can aid team functioning by regulating core team processes such as conflict.},

In this paper I argue that, thirty years after the publication of the Theory of Communicative Action, this thesis remains compelling. However, while Habermas offers a functionalist explanation of reification, his normative criticism of it remains largely implicit: he never explains what is wrong with reification from the perspective of the people whose social relations are reified. As a result, Habermas cannot explain why only some forms of colonization lead to reification effects. In particular, he suggests that reification effects result from the juridification of communicatively structured domains of action but not from the commodification of labour power. I criticize this argument and suggest that if the normative dimension of the colonization thesis is made explicit, a more nuanced explanation of reification becomes possible.},

In Physics of the Future, Michio Kaku--the New York Times bestselling author of Physics of the Impossible --gives us a stunning, provocative, and exhilarating vision of the coming century based on interviews with over three hundred of the world's top scientists who are already inventing the future in their labs. The result is the most authoritative and scientifically accurate description of the revolutionary developments taking place in medicine, computers, artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, energy production, and astronautics. In all likelihood, by 2100 we will control computers via tiny brain sensors and, like magicians, move objects around with the power of our minds. Artificial intelligence will be dispersed throughout the environment, and Internet-enabled contact lenses will allow us to access the world's information base or conjure up any image we desire in the blink of an eye. Meanwhile, cars will drive themselves using GPS, and if room-temperature superconductors are discovered, vehicles will effortlessly fly on a cushion of air, coasting on powerful magnetic fields and ushering in the age of magnetism. Using molecular medicine, scientists will be able to grow almost every organ of the body and cure genetic diseases. Millions of tiny DNA sensors and nanoparticles patrolling our blood cells will silently scan our bodies for the first sign of illness, while rapid advances in genetic research will enable us to slow down or maybe even reverse the aging process, allowing human life spans to increase dramatically. In space, radically new ships--needle-sized vessels using laser propulsion--could replace the expensive chemical rockets of today and perhaps visit nearby stars. Advances in nanotechnology may lead to the fabled space elevator, which would propel humans hundreds of miles above the earth's atmosphere at the push of a button. But these astonishing revelations are only the tip of the iceberg . Kaku also discusses emotional robots, antimatter rockets, X-ray vision, and the ability to create new life-forms, and he considers the development of the world economy. He addresses the key questions: Who are the winner and losers of the future? Who will have jobs, and which nations will prosper? All the while, Kaku illuminates the rigorous scientific principles, examining the rate at which certain technologies are likely to mature, how far they can advance, and what their ultimate limitations and hazards are. Synthesizing a vast amount of information to construct an exciting look at the years leading up to 2100, Physics of the Future is a thrilling, wondrous ride through the next 100 years of breathtaking scientific revolution.

To win the game, players are required to arrive at a two-state solution of the conflict. 100 Israeli female students of Palestinian and Jewish origin either supporting or opposing this solution played the game singly or in dyads. The rules of the study required players in dyads to reach mutual agreement on every action in the game. Results indicated that 19 out of 25 dyads resolved the conflict in the game as opposed to 16 out of 50 single players. In addition, players in dyads took more political actions and less security actions than single players did. Finally, players in dyads preferred to focus more on political actions than on security actions in the game. The abovementioned results point out three key implications for peace education. First, PeaceMaker reduces the tension and the charged atmosphere between Jewish and Palestinian players. Second, the game should be played in dyads and not singly. Finally, dyads should be comprised of a Jewish player and a Palestinian player in order to challenge their interaction and game behavior.},

We focus on the assessment of this computerized simulation of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in order to identify the effects it might have in helping to narrow the knowledge gap between the players. In addition, we examine the role of news media use about the conflict in knowledge acquisition after playing the game. We conducted an experimental study with the participation of 185 Israeli undergraduate students of Jewish and Palestinian origin. In order to gauge the effect of the game with regard to knowledge acquisition about the conflict, we used a pre- and post-intervention experimental design and utilized questionnaires. We found that the knowledge gap between participants who held high levels of knowledge about the conflict and those who held low levels of knowledge about it before playing the game narrowed after playing it. Second, participants holding more knowledge about the conflict before playing the game were more likely to win it than those holding less knowledge. Finally, the game narrowed the knowledge gap between participants who consumed television (TV) as a major source of information about the conflict and those who did not consume it. Our results indicate that serious games like PeaceMaker are effective as a tool for PE, because they are useful in increasing knowledge about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and narrowing the knowledge gap between the players, particularly for young people who are direct parties to this conflict and native to the online world.},

It appeals to circular causality of the sort found in synergetic formulations of self-organization (e.g., the slaving principle) and models of coupled dynamical systems, using nonlinear Fokker Planck equations. Here, circular causality is induced by separating the states of a random dynamical system into external and internal states, where external states are subject to random fluctuations and internal states are not. This reduces the problem to finding some (deterministic) dynamics of the internal states that ensure the system visits a limited number of external states; in other words, the measure of its (random) attracting set, or the Shannon entropy of the external states is small. We motivate a solution using a principle of least action based on variational free energy (from statistical physics) and establish the conditions under which it is formally equivalent to the information bottleneck method. This approach has proved useful in understanding the functional architecture of the brain. The generality of variational free energy minimisation and corresponding information theoretic formulations may speak to interesting applications beyond the neurosciences; e.g., in molecular or evolutionary biology.},

In particular, we redesign the generator normalization, revisit progressive growing, and regularize the generator to encourage good conditioning in the mapping from latent codes to images. In addition to improving image quality, this path length regularizer yields the additional benefit that the generator becomes significantly easier to invert. This makes it possible to reliably attribute a generated image to a particular network. We furthermore visualize how well the generator utilizes its output resolution, and identify a capacity problem, motivating us to train larger models for additional quality improvements. Overall, our improved model redefines the state of the art in unconditional image modeling, both in terms of existing distribution quality metrics as well as perceived image quality.},

Research has shown that CMC influences the attributions that individuals make regarding self-disclosure as well as the affection that they feel towards disclosers as a result of these attributions. However, little is known about the impact that attributions have on one's own reciprocal self-disclosure. In an original experiment, dyads of friends or strangers disclosed to one another in text-based CMC. After their discussion, a questionnaire assessed participants' liking toward their partners as well as their attributions regarding their partners' behavior. Results show that selfdisclosure prompted receivers' interpersonal attributions, which led receivers to like their partners. But, receivers' interpersonal attributions did not lead to reciprocal disclosure. The results corroborate Jiang, Bazarova, and Hancock's (2011) model that links self-disclosure and liking by way of interpersonal attributions, and demonstrate one disclosure-liking effect in CMC: People like those who self-disclose to them. This study provides further evidence for CMC's unique impact on the relationship between selfdisclosure and liking, and contributes to our understanding of the interpersonal processes that lead to liking in CMC.},

  abstract = {Although women's participation in tertiary education and the labour force has expanded over the past decades, women continue to be underrepresented in technical and managerial occupations. We analyse if gender inequalities also manifest themselves in online populations of professionals by leveraging audience estimates from LinkedIn's advertisement platform to explore gender gaps among LinkedIn users across countries, ages, industries and seniorities. We further validate LinkedIn gender gaps against ground truth professional gender gap indicators derived from the International Labour Organization's (ILO) Statistical Database, and examine the feasibility and biases of predicting global professional gender gap indicators using gender gaps computed from LinkedIn's online population. We find that women are significantly underrepresented relative to men on LinkedIn in countries in Africa, the Middle East and South Asia, among older individuals, in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields and higher-level managerial positions. Furthermore, a simple, aggregate indicator of the female-to-male ratio of LinkedIn users, which we term the LinkedIn Gender Gap Index (GGI), shows strong positive correlations with ILO ground truth professional gender gaps. A parsimonious regression model using the LinkedIn GGI to predict ILO professional gender gaps enables us to expand country coverage of different ILO indicators, albeit with better performance for general professional gender gaps than managerial gender gaps. Nevertheless, predictions generated using the LinkedIn population show some distinctive biases. Notably, we find that in countries where there is greater gender inequality in internet access, LinkedIn data predict greater gender equality than the ground truth, indicating an overrepresentation of high status women online in these settings. Our work contributes to a growing literature seeking to harness the `data revolution' for global sustainable development by evaluating the potential of a novel data source for filling gender data gaps and monitoring key indicators linked to women's economic empowerment.},

  abstract = {Many efforts have failed to achieve tangible models of a robotic theatre, as opposed to virtual or simulated theatres, despite many attempts to merge the progress of robotics with the growth of theatre and the performing arts. Many of the initiatives that have achieved significant progress in these domains are on a considerably larger scale, with the primary goal of entertaining rather than demonstrating the interdisciplinary nature of Robotics and Engineering. The purpose of this paper is to correctly unite the principles of Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics in a small size robotic theatre that will allow for a more portable and changeable exhibition. The Tortoise and Hare play will be performed in the theatre, which is made up of both stage and puppet elements. A pan and tilt lighting system, audio integration via an external device, automated curtains with stepper motors, props, and a grid stage are among the stage's components. A camera tracking module in the light system detects the location of a robot and communicates with the light fixtures to angle the spotlight. A transportable module that interacts wirelessly with its environment, as well as simple-moving, decorative puppet cutouts protruding from the module, make up the smart puppets. The mBlock IDE is used to edit the story in the theatre software, providing for a simple technique of programming the scene. The Smart Mini Theatre's production of the Tortoise and Hare play intends to encourage performing arts students to experiment with robots and programming to create their own shows, in the hopes of inspiring them to pursue Robotics and Engineering as a potential career choice.},

  abstract = {A design and manufacturing method is described for creating a motor tendon--actuated soft foam robot. The method uses a castable, light, and easily compressible open-cell polyurethane foam, producing a structure capable of large ({$\sim$}70\% strain) deformations while requiring low torques to operate ({$<$}0.2 N{$\cdot$}m). The soft robot can change shape, by compressing and folding, allowing for complex locomotion with only two actuators. Achievable motions include forward locomotion at 13 mm/s (4.3\% of body length per second), turning at 9{\textopenbullet}/s, and end-over-end flipping. Hard components, such as motors, are loosely sutured into cavities after molding. This reduces unwanted stiffening of the soft body. This work is the first demonstration of a soft open-cell foam robot locomoting with motor tendon actuators. The manufacturing method is rapid ({$\sim$}30 min per mold), inexpensive (under \$3 per robot for the structural foam), and flexible, and will allow a variety of soft foam robotic devices to be produced.},

In physical spatial collaboration such as team dancing, theatrical performance, and team sport, one's behavior should be in accord with the partner's; the relative position in distance and in direction is critically important all the time even when moving. To realize remote physical spatial collaboration, achieving the shared recognition of positional relationship is one of the key issues. In this paper, we propose a setup between two remote sites where each collaborator immerses in the other remote site by a telepresence robot situated in the other site. The telepresence robot is a wheeled platform with a camera attached at man's eye height. It moves in response to the remote user's position and orientation and enables the user to get the first-person view video through a head-mounted display. By using two telepresence robots from both sites, both collaborators can recognize the partner being in front of him/her and can grasp the distance and the orientation of the partner in remote site. In the proposed setup, users can grasp the positional relationship as accurate and quick as the existing fixed views including the bird's-eye view.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}The success of live comedy depends on a performer's ability to ``work'' an audience. Ethnographic studies suggest that this involves the co-ordinated use of subtle social signals such as body orientation, gesture, gaze by both performers and audience members. Robots provide a unique opportunity to test the effects of these signals experimentally. Using a life-size humanoid robot, programmed to perform a stand-up comedy routine, we manipulated the robot's patterns of gesture and gaze and examined their effects on the real-time responses of a live audience. The strength and type of responses were captured using SHORE™computer vision analytics. The results highlight the complex, reciprocal social dynamics of performer and audience behavior. People respond more positively when the robot looks at them, negatively when it looks away and performative gestures also contribute to different patterns of audience response. This demonstrates how the responses of individual audience members depend on the specific interaction they're having with the performer. This work provides insights into how to design more effective, more socially engaging forms of robot interaction that can be used in a variety of service contexts.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The system consists of a head-mounted display (HMD) that shows the performer the video recording of the puppet's view, a microphone for voice capture, and photoreflectors for detecting the mouth movements of the human performer. In conventional puppetry, there is also the need for practice in the manipulation of the puppets to achieve good performance. The proposed telepresence system addresses these issues by enabling the human performer to manipulate the puppet through their own body and facial movements. The proposed system is expected to contribute to the development of new applications of puppetry and expand the interactivity of puppetry and the scope of entertainment.},

English, as an International Language (EIL), has considerable status in various domains of society in the region. It acts as a means of striving toward greater communication and understanding between the two language communities, with potential to foster peace and understanding in the region. While we take the use of Arabic and Hebrew into account, we focus on how the shared use of English is or can be employed as a mediator. We explore the focal language situations through sociolinguistic and pedagogical lenses, with a view to identifying commonalities in places, spaces, and events which evidence awareness of social justice or the manifestation of humanitarian ideals. We close this paper with some suggestions, drawn from our findings, for worthwhile ventures for TESOL educators who wish to enable their students to work toward a more peaceful present and future in areas of conflict.},

One uses speculative design to reflect on and inform ethnographic fieldwork on busyness in middle-class families; the other uses speculative design to complement late-stage analysis of a historical ethnography of rural technological infrastructure. Rather than trying to do away with the gap between ethnography and design by seamlessly integrating the two processes, we reworked the relationship between ethnography and design by closing the gap in the temporal workflows while simultaneously maintaining a distinction in the performance of the two roles. We found that this new gap resulted in a series of misunderstandings; but by putting the two roles in active dialogue, we were able leverage misunderstandings into mutual benefit.},

Stigma leads to feelings of shame and disgrace, and marginalizes persons living with HIV and their caregivers by marring social relationships and impacting health outcomes. In April 2019 Ratodero Tehsil in Larkana District, Pakistan, had an HIV outbreak, where evidence highlighted increase in infection rates among non-high-risk populations, including children. In the aftermath of this outbreak, affected families faced loss of communal ties in part due to stigmatizing attitudes. The Sujaag Project employed Participatory Action Research strategies to address HIV-based stigma and enhance acceptance of people living with HIV in the region. By utilizing a qualitative methodology, this study reports manifestations in changes in HIV stigma at four layers of the Socioecological Model: Individual, Interpersonal, Community and Social, and Macro levels. Findings from focus group discussions and reflective narrative reports gathered at varied points of the project cycle create an understanding of how HIV-related stigma affects wellbeing and how a collaborative and participatory approach aids in re-establishment of social relationships. This study informs contextual methodologies for incorporating lived experiences of HIV in program design, service delivery, and policy influence, and can be adapted for other stigmatized illnesses in similar contexts.},

A series of studies that explored how people participate in CMC and how computerization affects group efforts to reach consensus is described; results indicate differences in participation, decisions, and interaction among groups meeting face to face and in simultaneous computer-linked discourse and communication by electronic mail. Findings are attributed to difficulties of coordination from lack of informational feedback, absence of social influence cues for controlling discussion, and depersonalization from lack of nonverbal involvement and absence of norms.

Nevertheless, exploitation of immersive virtual reality has allowed a reframing of this question to whether it is possible to experience the same sensations towards a virtual body inside an immersive virtual environment as toward the biological body, and if so, to what extent. The current paper addresses these issues by referring to the Sense of Embodiment (SoE). Due to the conceptual confusion around this sense, we provide a working definition which states that SoE consists of three subcomponents: the sense of self-location, the sense of agency, and the sense of body ownership. Under this proposed structure, measures and experimental manipulations reported in the literature are reviewed and related challenges are outlined. Finally, future experimental studies are proposed to overcome those challenges, toward deepening the concept of SoE and enhancing it in virtual applications.},

  abstract = {Nature demonstrates adaptive and extreme shape morphing via unique patterns of movement. Many of them have been explained by monolithic shape-changing mechanisms, such as chemical swelling, skin stretching, origami/kirigami morphing, or geometric eversion, that were successfully mimicked in artificial analogs. However, there still remains an unexplored regime of natural morphing that cannot be reproduced in artificial systems by a ``single-mode'' morphing mechanism. One example is the ``dual-mode'' morphing of               Eurypharynx pelecanoides               (commonly known as the pelican eel), which first unfolds and then inflates its mouth to maximize the probability of engulfing the prey. Here, we introduce pelican eel--inspired dual-morphing architectures that embody quasi-sequential behaviors of origami unfolding and skin stretching in response to fluid pressure. In the proposed system, fluid paths were enclosed and guided by a set of entirely stretchable origami units that imitate the morphing principle of the pelican eel's stretchable and foldable frames. This geometric and elastomeric design of fluid networks, in which fluid pressure acts in the direction that the whole body deploys first, resulted in a quasi-sequential dual-morphing response. To verify the effectiveness of our design rule, we built an artificial creature mimicking a pelican eel and reproduced biomimetic dual-morphing behavior. By compositing the basic dual-morphing unit cells into conventional origami frames, we demonstrated architectures of soft machines that exhibit deployment-combined adaptive gripping, crawling, and large range of underwater motion. This design principle may provide guidance for designing bioinspired, adaptive, and extreme shape-morphing systems.},

  abstract = {The human hand is one of the most complex and compact grippers that has arisen as a product of natural genetic engineering; it is highly versatile, as it handles power and precision tasks. Since proper contact points and force directions are required to ensure versatility and secure a stable grip on an object, there must be a large workspace and controllable tip force directions for the digits. Although they are important, many individuals with neuromuscular diseases experience loss of these features. Thus, we propose a high-degree-of-freedom (DOF) soft robotic glove inspired by the anatomical features of human hands. The mechanism for adjusting the position and force direction of each tip is based on the structure of the extrinsic and intrinsic muscle--tendon units. The large thumb workspace was achieved by assisting opposition/reposition and flexion/extension to enable various grasping postures. A bidirectional actuation control mechanism with a cable-actuated agonist and an elastomer antagonist increased the assisted DOF and maintained compactness. The kinematic and kinetic performances of our device were evaluated by performing tests with eight stroke survivors. The thumb workspace increased by 43\%, 207\%, and 248\% in the distal--proximal, dorsal--palmar, and radial--ulnar directions, respectively. The pinching shear force decreased by 54\% and 45\% for the nonthumb digits and thumb, respectively. These device-assisted improvements allowed objects to be stably grasped and manipulated in various postures. The novel device can assist individuals with impaired hand function to improve their grasping performance. Clinical Research Information Service (CRIS) Registration Number: KCT0004855.},

We test two forms of online contact: encountering an outgroup member directly (direct online contact) or through an ingroup member (extended online contact) and their effects on outgroup attitudes, here various forms of threat and social distance. We also examine the emotional mechanisms through which these effects emerge. We rely on an online experiment (N {$\frac{1}{4}$} 396) testing online contact with two distinct outgroups, an undocumented immigrant or a gay person. Compared to the control, direct online contact decreased perceived threat and social distance toward gays and lesbians, but not toward undocumented immigrants. Direct online contact improved attitudes toward both outgroups through positive and negative emotions, whereas extended online contact reduced negative emotions, improving attitudes towards undocumented immigrants. We discuss theoretical, methodological and practical implications of these findings.},

The FEP is very ambitious, extending from the brain sciences to the biology of self-organisation. In this context, some find apparent discrepancies between the map (the FEP) and the territory (target systems) a compelling reason to defend instrumentalism about the FEP. We take this to be misguided. We identify an important fallacy made by those defending instrumentalism about the FEP. We call it the literalist fallacy: this is the fallacy of inferring the truth of instrumentalism based on the claim that the properties of FEP models do not literally map onto real-world, target systems. We conclude that scientific realism about the FEP is a live and tenable option.},

It does so by considering the boundaries of biological systems, from individual cells to Home sapiens, in terms of the presence of Markov blankets under the active inference scheme---a corollary of the free energy principle. A Markov blanket defines the boundaries of a system in a statistical sense. Here we consider how a collective of Markov blankets can self-assemble into a global system that itself has a Markov blanket; thereby providing an illustration of how autonomous systems can be understood as having layers of nested and self-sustaining boundaries. This allows us to show that: (i) any living system is a Markov blanketed system and (ii) the boundaries of such systems need not be co-extensive with the biophysical boundaries of a living organism. In other words, autonomous systems are hierarchically composed of Markov blankets of Markov blankets---all the way down to individual cells, all the way up to you and me, and all the way out to include elements of the local environment.},

In Study 1 (N = 122), we investigated predictors of social distance---as a proxy for prejudice---and found right-wing authoritarianism and intergroup anxiety to be significant predictors. In Study 2 (N = 162), we tested whether perceived acculturation orientation would predict social distance and found that Americans were less prejudiced toward Syrians who preferred to assimilate rather than integrate. Finally, in Study 3 (N = 153), we tested if a form of vicarious contact could reduce social distance via reduced intergroup anxiety; we found initial evidence for this mediation link. We discussed the potential for the vicarious contact intervention to foster positive intergroup relations and contribute to refugee wellbeing.},

If the body is a source of subjective knowledge, then it can also become an important means of creating ontological categories of self and society. The materiality of human representations within art traditions, then, can be interpreted as providing a means for contextualizing and aestheticizing the body in order to produce a symbolic and structural knowledge category.

To investigate design approaches to avatar systems and their impact on communication and interaction with people within this medium, we interviewed industry experts associated with a range of platforms including Rec Room, AltspaceVR, High Fidelity, VRChat, Anyland, and Mozilla Hubs. In analyzing the ways that design choices shape embodied experience, we map design approaches to avatar systems in this evolving landscape and make preliminary claims about the impact of these varying design approaches.},

  abstract = {Prior research with preschool children has established that dialogic or active book reading is an effective method for expanding young children's vocabulary. In this exploratory study, we asked whether similar benefits are observed when a robot engages in dialogic reading with preschoolers. Given the established effectiveness of active reading, we also asked whether this effectiveness was critically dependent on the expressive characteristics of the robot. For approximately half the children, the robot's active reading was expressive; the robot's voice included a wide range of intonation and emotion (Expressive). For the remaining children, the robot read and conversed with a flat voice, which sounded similar to a classic text-to-speech engine and had little dynamic range (Flat). The robot's movements were kept constant across conditions. We performed a verification study using Amazon Mechanical Turk to confirm that the Expressive robot was viewed as significantly more expressive, more emotional, and less passive than the Flat robot. We invited 45 preschoolers with an average age of 5 years who were either English Language Learners (ELL), bilingual, or native English speakers to engage in the reading task with the robot. The robot narrated a story from a picture book, using active reading techniques and including a set of target vocabulary words in the narration. Children were post-tested on the vocabulary words and were also asked to retell the story to a puppet. A subset of 34 children performed a second story retelling 4-6 weeks later. Children reported liking and learning from the robot a similar amount in the Expressive and Flat conditions. However, as compared to children in the Flat condition, children in the Expressive condition were more concentrated and engaged as indexed by their facial expressions; they emulated the robot's story more in their story retells; and they told longer stories during their delayed retelling. Furthermore, children who responded to the robot's active reading questions were more likely to correctly identify the target vocabulary words in the Expressive condition than in the Flat condition. Taken together, these results suggest that children may benefit more from the expressive robot than from the flat robot.},

It describes the central role of spiritual transformation in healers from which emerges their capacity for relation and empathy. Many spirit healers, following a spiritual transformation, begin to exercise `radical empathy,' in which individual differences between healer and sufferer are melded into one field of feeling and experience. The model is compared and contrasted with aspects of healing processes in some psychotherapeutic and analytic therapies. These comparisons are offered in the light of the growing interest in incorporating spirituality into psychological and medical treatments. A concluding section briefly explores some implications of aspects of the model of healing process that support the claim that it is widely applicable and identifies foundational components.},

For this purpose, we built Keepon, which is a small creature-like robot, and observed how autistic and typically-developing children (2--4 years old) interacted with it. Keepon was placed in their playrooms just as one of their toys, and tele-controlled by a human operator in a remote room; the children naturally and spontaneously showed various communicative actions to Keepon. From the longitudinal observations for more than two years (over 100 sessions of 3 hours) in a remedial institute and a preschool, we found that Keepon's comprehensive appearance and predictable responses gave the children a playful and relaxed mood, in which they spontaneously engaged in dyadic interaction with Keepon, and also that the typically-developing children and some of the autistic children extended the interaction into triadic one, where Keepon worked as the pivot of interpersonal play with their caregivers. Each child showed a different style and a different unfolding of interaction over time, which tell us a ``story'' of his or her personality and developmental profile, which is informative for the caregiver and the nursing staff to understand the child better, and is now being utilized for improving the remedial and educational services.},

  abstract = {One of the unique features of Israel's legal, military, and political                     control over the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT) has been the review by  the Supreme                         Court of Israel of the actions and decisions of the authorities in                     those territories. Sitting as a High Court of Justice that has the competence to                     review the actions of all persons exercising public functions under law, the                     Court has entertained thousands of petitions relating to the legality of such                     varied actions as house demolitions, deportations, land requisition, entry                     permits, and establishment of settlements. There can be little doubt that the                     very existence of judicial review has had a restraining effect on the                     authorities. While the Court has not ruled against the government that often,                     and has provided legitimization for acts of dubious legality, such as punitive                     house demolitions and deportations, it has handed down some important                         rulings on questions of principle. Furthermore, in the shadow of the                     Court, many petitions have been settled without a court ruling, allowing for a                     full or partial remedy for the Palestinian petitioner.},

In this paper, an overview of the various systems, application areas, and challenges found in the literature concerning mobile robotic telepresence is provided. The survey also proposes a set terminology for the field as there is currently a lack of standard terms for the different concepts related to MRP systems. Further, this paper provides an outlook on the various research directions for developing and enhancing mobile robotic telepresence systems per se, as well as evaluating the interaction in laboratory and field settings. Finally, the survey outlines a number of design implications for the future of mobile robotic telepresence systems for social interaction.},

  abstract = {Although the act of dehumanizing an outgroup is a pervasive and potent intergroup process that drives discrimination and conflict, no formal research has examined the consequences of being dehumanized by an outgroup---that is, ``metadehumanization.'' Across 10 studies (N ϭ 3,440) involving several real-world conflicts spanning 3 continents, we provide the first empirical evidence that metadehumanization (a) plays a central role in outgroup aggression that is (b) mediated by outgroup dehumanization, and (c) distinct from metaprejudice. Studies 1a and 1b demonstrate experimentally that Americans who learn that Arabs (Study 1a) or Muslims (Study 1b) blatantly dehumanize Americans are more likely to dehumanize that outgroup in return; by contrast, experimentally increasing outgroup dehumanization did not increase metadehumanization (Study 1c). Using correlational data, Study 2 documents indirect effects of metadehumanization on Americans' support for aggressive policies toward Arabs (e.g., torture) via Arab dehumanization. In the context of Hungarians and ethnic minority Roma, Study 3 shows that the pathway for Hungarians from metadehumanization to aggression through outgroup dehumanization holds controlling for outgroup prejudice. Study 4 examines Israelis' metaperceptions with respect to Palestinians, showing that: (a) feeling dehumanized (i.e., metadehumanization) is distinct from feeling disliked (i.e., metaprejudice), and (b) metadehumanization uniquely influences aggression through outgroup dehumanization, controlling for metaprejudice. Studies 5a and 5b explore Americans' metaperceptions regarding ISIS and Iran. We document a dehumanization-specific pathway from metadehumanization to aggressive attitudes and behavior that is distinct from the path from metaprejudice through prejudice to aggression. In Study 6, American participants learning that Muslims humanize Americans (i.e., metahumanization) humanize Muslims in turn. Finally, Study 7 experimentally contrasts metadehumanization and metahumanization primes, and shows that resulting differences in outgroup dehumanization are mediated by (a) perceived identity threat, and (b) a general desire to reciprocate the outgroup's perceptions of the ingroup. In summary, our research outlines how and why metadehumanization contributes to cycles of ongoing violence and animosity, providing direction for future research and policy.},

Limited research to date has studied the influence of users' attributes (such as age and gender) on the acceptance of service robots and the implications for HRI design. This paper describes the development of a social interactive healthcare robot named Charles, capable of measuring blood pressure. Using blood pressure monitoring as the service scenario, a user study was conducted to investigate the differences between two age groups (40 to 65 years and over 65 years) in attitudes and reactions before and after their interactions with Charles. The results showed few differences between the two age groups. A significant gender effect was found, with males having a more positive attitude toward robots in healthcare than females. This study reveals the importance of considering gender issues in the design of healthcare robots for older people. Overall, the performance of the robot was rated high, however the participants expressed desires to have more interactiveness and a better voice from the robot. According to our sample, age need not be a barrier to users' acceptance of healthcare robots.},

Recent invented media resemble cute animals or imaginary creatures that quickly attract attention. However, such appearances could distort tele-communications because they are different from human beings. This paper studies the effect on the speaker's personality that is transmitted through physical media by regarding appearances as a function that transmits the speaker's information. Although communication media's capability to transmit information reportedly influences conversations in many aspects, the effect of appearances remains unclear. To reveal the effect of appearance, we compared three appearances of communication media: stuffed-bear teleoperated robot, human-like teleoperated robot, and video chat. Our results show that communication media whose appearance greatly differs from that of the speaker distorts the personality perceived by interlocutors. This paper suggests that the design of the appearance of physical communication media needs to be carefully selected.},

Our work explores the processes by which public artists and political activists contribute to public spaces, introducing opportunities for HCI researchers to engage with the people who shape the aesthetic feel of our cities. We present WallBots-autonomous, wall-crawling robots as a research probe for public expression across a wide range of surfaces and hard-to-reach places, including bus stops, whiteboards, streetpoles, trashcans, moving vehicles and building walls. We evaluate WallBots as a low-cost DIY authoring tool for public artists and activists. Our study of six individuals who extensively contribute to public spaces offers insights into the materials and practices behind grassroots public expression. We then leverage feedback from participants, among them a graffiti artist, light painter, political activists, and street musician, to evaluate interaction techniques for manipulating WallBots as a medium for public expression across a range of surfaces. Our findings expose a research space for technological interventions in the context of street art, and we conclude with design insights for magnetic kinetic systems as an approach for supporting engagement, expression and creativity in public spaces.},

  abstract = {The aim of our study is to investigate systems for supporting remote instruction via a mobile robot. In the real world, instructions are typically given through words and body orientations such as head movements, which make it possible to project others' actions. Projectability is an important resource in organizing multiple actions among multiple participants in co-ordination with one another. It can likewise be said that in the case of robot-human collaboration, it is necessary to design a robot's head so that a local participant can project the robot's (and remote person's) actions. GestureMan is a robot that is designed to support such projectability properties. It is argued that a remote controlled mobile robot, designed as a communication medium, makes relevant dual ecologies: ecology at a remote (robot operator's) site and at a local participant's (robot's) site. In order to design a robot as a viable communication medium, it is essential to consider how these ecologies can be mediated and supported.},

It is argued that the use of a remote-controlled robot as a device to support communication involves two distinct ecologies: an ecology at the remote (instructor's) site and an ecology at the operator's (robot) site. In designing a robot as a viable communication medium, it is essential to consider how these ecologies can be mediated and supported. In this paper, we propose design guidelines to overcome the problems inherent in dual ecologies, and describe the development of a robot named GestureMan-3 based on these guidelines.

At their best, these moments have created a performance from the patient's story that has become shared. Moments of animation in the hospice are meetings between me and a person who is in palliative care. I have facilitated our meeting and brought a suitcase full of everyday objects with me. A patient is given a story and then cast in their own story with objects they have chosen. Meetings with patients in palliative care made me think about patients moral agency. A moral agent is a being who consciously puts moral activities into practice. Expressive objects telling stories for a patient is one place where moral agency survives in the hospice setting and where a palliative care patient can act for a while as a member of a moral community. In this article, I share my model of expressive objects related to my practice.},

In this work we propose combining two independent prediction models. A continuous model predicts the upcoming end of the turn in order to generate gaze aversion and fillers as turn-taking cues. This prediction is done while the user is speaking, so turn-taking can be done with little silence between turns, or even overlap. Once a speech recognition result has been received at a later time, a second model uses the lexical information to decide if or when the turn should actually be taken. We constructed the continuous model using the speaker's prosodic features as inputs and evaluated its online performance. We then conducted a subjective experiment in which we implemented our model in an android robot and asked participants to compare it to one without turn-taking cues, which produces a response when a speech recognition result is received. We found that using both gaze aversion and a filler was preferred when the continuous model correctly predicted the upcoming end of turn, while using only gaze aversion was better if the prediction was wrong.},

Unfortunately, the use of antibiotics selects for resistance at answering scale. The turn to the study of antibiotic resistance in microbiology and medicine is examined, focusing on the realization that individual therapies targeted at single pathogens in individual bodies are environmental events affecting bacterial evolution far beyond bodies. In turning to biological manifestations of antibiotic use, sciences fathom material outcomes of their own previous concepts. Archival work with stored soil and clinical samples produces a record described here as `the biology of history': the physical registration of human history in bacterial life. This account thus foregrounds the importance of understanding both the materiality of history and the historicity of matter in theories and concepts of life today.},

  abstract = {In order to enable the widespread use of robots in home and office environments, systems with natural interaction capabilities have to be developed. A prerequisite for natural interaction is the robot's ability to automatically recognize when and how long a person's attention is directed towards it for communication. As in open environments several persons can be present simultaneously, the detection of the communication partner is of particular importance. In this paper we present an attention system for a mobile robot which enables the robot to shift its attention to the person of interest and to maintain attention during interaction. Our approach is based on a method for multi-modal person tracking which uses a pan-tilt camera for face recognition, two microphones for sound source localization, and a laser range finder for leg detection. Shifting of attention is realized by turning the camera into the direction of the person which is currently speaking. From the orientation of the head it is decided whether the speaker addresses the robot. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated with an evaluation. In addition, qualitative results from the performance of the robot at the exhibition part of the ICVS'03 are provided.},

We argue that ICTs are instrumental in supporting and shaping three alternate information practices---situating, codification, and scaffolding---that each serve the goals of direct democratic engagement. We also show how local activist communities engage in these three practices through their varied use of ICTs, including the ways they provide mechanisms for informal but politically significant---and legitimate---civic engagement.},

With the advent of activism-related scholarship in HCI and CSCW, the current challenge involves thinking about what activism is, who an activist is, and the opportunities and limitations of activism. Recently, researchers in academia and industry, such as Timnit Gebru, demonstrate a commitment to stay activated for the structural changes we need, for example, diverse and inclusive scholarship, to address overlapping problems, e.g., sexism, racism, and tokenism. Additionally, there is a continuing dominance of Western, formally educated, industrialized, rich and democratic (WEIRD) perspectives. Countering this requires collective efforts in citational justice and decolonial computing, among others. But such complex issues do not yet cover the inner conflicts that we face, such as mental health struggles while dismantling the prejudices stemming from the ivory tower, locating our privileges as academics while traversing less privileged locales of research sites, or the dilemmas on whether we are doing enough to fulfill our responsibilities to the people who have trusted us enough to work with us in the face of "publish or perish" culture. This workshop explores what activism means within the CSCW community and how we can remain activated while harboring doubts and hopes in calling ourselves "activists".},

A path analysis reveals that the feeling of the agent's social presence mediates the participants' evaluation of the social agent. Experiment 2 (N=32) shows that physical embodiment with restricted tactile interaction causes null or even negative effects in human--agent interaction. In addition, Experiment 2 indicates that lonely people feel higher social presence of social agents, and provide more positive social responses to social agents than non-lonely people. The importance of physical embodiment and tactile communication in human--agent interaction and the diverse role of social robots, especially for the lonely population, are discussed.},

  abstract = {Soft pneumatic actuators using either pressurized air or vacuum pressure are the soft actuators with the most potential for real-life applications, but their energy efficiency has not been studied in much detail. In this work, a model-based method is presented that can predict the energy efficiency of origami-based vacuum pneumatic artificial muscles (OV-PAMs) while considering the characteristics of the pump used. This model was applied using both the manufacturer's data and experimental data to extrapolate the efficiency and flow rate of the pump which can then be used to optimize the dimensions of the actuator based on the target payload. It is then demonstrated that OV-PAMs can be used as a lightweight, low-cost, portable and powerful actuation solution paired with either batteries or solar panels and lightweight pumps. By optimizing its parameters, it will be possible to implement this actuator for the automation of low-cost off-grid operations and for field robots that can collaborate with humans.},

The results suggest that technological mediation influences decision making, but its influence depends on an individual's self-construal: participants who saw themselves as defined through their relationships (interdependent self-construal) recommended riskier and more painful treatments in video conferencing than when face-to-face. We discuss implications of our results for theory and future research.},

One set of technologies that are emerging on the commercial market is mobile remote presence (MRP) systems, physically embodied videoconferencing systems that remote workers use to drive through a workplace, communicating with locals there. Our interviews, observations, and survey results from people, who had 2-18 months of MRP use, showed how remotely-controlled mobility enabled remote workers to live and work with local coworkers almost as if they were physically there. The MRP supported informal communications and connections between distributed coworkers. We also found that the mobile embodiment of the remote worker evoked orientations toward the MRP both as a person and as a machine, leading to formation of new usage norms among remote and local coworkers.},

  abstract = {A novel linear actuator called origami-based vacuum pneumatic artificial muscle (OV-PAM) is proposed in this study that can produce large forces ({$>$}400 N) with a contraction ratio {$>$}90\% of the active length of the actuator. Moreover, some of the designs presented in this article can lift large loads with large contraction ratios at extremely low vacuum pressure (\&10 kPa). This actuator consists of a sealed origami film chamber connecting a polygonal top and bottom plate with evenly spaced transversal reinforcements that prevent the chamber from contracting laterally at certain points of the actuator under vacuum pressure. As vacuum pressure is applied, both a tension force in the walls and a vertical force on the bottom plate of the actuator generate a large contractile force, and the force on the bottom plate can produce a consistent force throughout the entire motion. A quasistatic analytical model was developed that can accurately predict the behavior of the actuator and that can be used for actuator design. OV-PAMs are lightweight, have large contractile forces throughout their entire motion and large contraction ratios. It can also produce large forces at low pressures with large cross-sectional areas. Their versatility could make them well suited for a wide range of applications. They could take us closer to a future where robots can cooperate with humans to shape a better future.},

To address this problem, we present the convolutional deep belief network, a hierarchical generative model that scales to realistic image sizes. This model is translation-invariant and supports efficient bottom-up and top-down probabilistic inference. Key to our approach is probabilistic max-pooling, a novel technique that shrinks the representations of higher layers in a probabilistically sound way. Our experiments show that the algorithm learns useful high-level visual features, such as object parts, from unlabeled images of objects and natural scenes. We demonstrate excellent performance on several visual recognition tasks and show that our model can perform hierarchical (bottom-up and top-down) inference over full-sized images.},

  abstract = {While telepresence robots have increasingly become accepted in diverse settings, the research on their acceptance in educational contexts has been underdeveloped. This study analyzed how the use intention of telepresence robots can be influenced by perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, subjective norm, and perceived risk for students, faculty, and staff in higher education. Survey data were collected from 60 participants with direct operator experience with a variety of telepresence robots deployed in a large research university in the Midwest region of the United States. Path analysis results indicated that perceived usefulness was the only significant direct predictor of use intention of telepresence robots. Both perceived ease of use and subjective norm had a significant positive effect on perceived usefulness. Subjective norm also had a significant positive indirect effect on use intention, mediated by perceived usefulness. Perceived risk had a negative effect on perceived ease of use. These findings indicated that the usefulness of robots was central to operators' decisions to use telepresence robots. Therefore, design choice for telepresence robots should prioritize usefulness. Secondly, the design of telepresence robots should minimize complexity for the end user and minimize cognitive demand. Having nominal difficulty of use would also facilitate multiple embodiments by combining telepresence robots with other technologies to support more rich social interactions.},

Up to now, a meta-analysis summarizing the results of real-world interventions that rest on the intergroup contact theory has been missing. We included evaluations of programs realizing direct (i.e., face-to-face) and/or indirect (i.e., extended or virtual) contact in realworld settings outside the lab. The interventions' effectiveness was tested shortly after their end (k = 123 comparisons, N = 11 371 participants) and with a delay of at least 1 month (k = 25, N = 1650). Our data show that contact interventions improve ethnic attitudes. Importantly, changes persist over time. Furthermore, not only direct but also indirect contact interventions are successful. In addition, contact programs are effective even in the context of a serious societal conflict (e.g., in the Middle East). Although changes are typically larger for ethnic majorities, there is an impact on minorities, too. Finally, contact interventions not only improve attitudes toward individuals involved in the program, their effects also generalize to outgroups as a whole. In sum, social psychology provides an intervention for prejudice reduction that can be successfully implemented in the practical field. Copyright {\copyright} 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

It begins by providing a brief overview of the sociomaterial perspective on organizational practices and considers why this perspective holds great appeal at this point in time. I then engage with Mutch's (2013) critique of the agential realist foundation upon which most current discussions of sociomateriality are constructed to highlight what practical problems are generated when authors attempt to map agential realism's philosophical discussion onto empirical phenomena. Next, I attempt to make explicit what Mutch leaves implicit in his paper: how building studies of sociomateriality on the theoretical foundation offered by critical realism can, potentially, overcome some of the practical problems created by a footing on agential realism. Finally, I push Mutch's arguments one step further to compare what practical consequences arise when researchers attempt to construct studies of sociomateriality on either of these two theoretical foundations. I suggest that there are important implications for what one can study, how one can study it, and how scholars can contribute to theory on technology and organizing based on the theoretical foundation they choose to build upon.},

Telepresence robotics is seen as an approach that, through the embodied agent of a robotic body, enhances student social presence in the classroom, improving the quality of classroom interaction. In the literature review, we analyzed the current state of research on using telepresence robots in higher education, and, based on existing papers, studied the strengths and weaknesses of using these robots in higher education. Based on our findings, we suggest that the literature in this area is scarce, requiring further studies in the future. The current telepresence robots struggle in relaying flawless telepresence experience, but can still be recommended in certain scenarios. We conclude that despite telepresence robotics being a promising technology, longitudinal studies are required to reach better understanding about the features that telepresence robots should have when used in higher education and about the best use methods.},

However, participants did not respond differently to physical robots and virtual agents when both were displayed digitally on a screen -- suggesting that physical presence, rather than physical embodiment, characterizes people's responses to social robots. Implications for understanding psychological response to physical and virtual agents and for methodological design are discussed.},

However, possible system limitations of VR could influence the results such that they do not fully reflect real-life encounters with robots. In order to better deploy VR in HRI, we need to establish a basic understanding of what the differences are between HRI studies in the real world and in VR. This paper investigates the differences between the real life and VR with a focus on proxemic preferences, in combination with exploring the effects of visual familiarity and spatial sound within the VR experience. Results suggested that people prefer closer interaction distances with a real, physical robot than with a virtual robot in VR. Additionally, the virtual robot was perceived as more discomforting than the real robot, which could result in the differences in proxemics. Overall, these results indicate that the perception of the robot has to be evaluated before the interaction can be studied. However, the results also suggested that VR settings with different visual familiarities are consistent with each other in how they affect HRI proxemics and virtual robot perceptions, indicating the freedom to study HRI in various scenarios in VR. The effect of spatial sound in VR drew a more complex picture and thus calls for more in-depth research to understand its influence on HRI in VR.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we first formulate the confinementescape problem of a defender and an evader who attempts escaping from a circular region, which differs from the traditional pursuit-evasion problems. In our setting of the confinementescape problem, the defender is restricted to move and patrol on the circle, trying to prevent possible escape of the evader who is initially located inside the circle. We describe and characterize some general properties of the problem, and then design two bio-inspired control strategies for the evader and the defender, respectively. In addition, we illustrate some possible motion patterns of the system, investigate the escaping time as a function of the relative-initial-positions of the agents, as well as the winning sets of the two players, respectively, under different systemparameters. To that end, we characterize the contour lines of the winning sets with their gradient properties. Finally, we indicate the abrupt phase transitions between successful confinement and escaping, revealing the strong sensitivity and nonlinearities of the system under critical conditions.},

We provide evidence for a set of phenomena characteristic of the organization of ``video-in-interaction'': (a) mobile and Skype video calls are patterned, often alternating between a ``talking heads'' arrangement, in which both participants are on-screen and facing the camera, and moments in which they are producing various shots of their environment in line with their current interactional purposes; (b) openings occur almost always in the talking heads arrangement; (c) the video images on either side are produced and expected to be scrutinized with respect to their relevance to the ongoing interaction; (d) the talking heads arrangement is oriented to a default mode of interaction, with the implication that when there is nothing else relevant to show, the participants should show themselves on-screen; (e) in multiparty interactions, the party who is handling the video communication apparatus has an obligation to put other speakers on-screen when they talk, and the video callers orient to their appearance on-screen as making a distinctive participation status relevant. We show how these phenomena all derive from an orientation toward a single maxim, ``put the face of the current speaker on-screen,'' which plays a foundational role in the organization of video-in-interaction and its articulation with that of talk-in-interaction.},

The reward signal from a poor discriminator can be very sparse and unstable, which may lead the generator to fall into a local optimum or to produce nonsense replies. To alleviate the first problem, we first extend a recently proposed adversarial dialogue generation method to an adversarial imitation learning solution. Then, in the framework of adversarial inverse reinforcement learning, we propose a new reward model for dialogue generation that can provide a more accurate and precise reward signal for generator training. We evaluate the performance of the resulting model with automatic metrics and human evaluations in two annotation settings. Our experimental results demonstrate that our model can generate more high-quality responses and achieve higher overall performance than the state-of-the-art.},

However, the design, fabrication, and implementation of artificial muscles are often limited by their material costs, operating principle, scalability, and single-degree-of-freedom contractile actuation motions. Here we propose an architecture for fluid-driven origami-inspired artificial muscles. This concept requires only a compressible skeleton, a flexible skin, and a fluid medium. A mechanical model is developed to explain the interaction of the three components. A fabrication method is introduced to rapidly manufacture low-cost artificial muscles using various materials and at multiple scales. The artificial muscles can be programed to achieve multiaxial motions including contraction, bending, and torsion. These motions can be aggregated into systems with multiple degrees of freedom, which are able to produce controllable motions at different rates. Our artificial muscles can be driven by fluids at negative pressures (relative to ambient). This feature makes actuation safer than most other fluidic artificial muscles that operate with positive pressures. Experiments reveal that these muscles can contract over 90\% of their initial lengths, generate stresses of {$\sim$}600 kPa, and produce peak power densities over 2 kW/kg---all equal to, or in excess of, natural muscle. This architecture for artificial muscles opens the door to rapid design and low-cost fabrication of actuation systems for numerous applications at multiple scales, ranging from miniature medical devices to wearable robotic exoskeletons to large deployable structures for space exploration.}

Recently, because of the expensive cost of this traditional performance (such as professional stage, high cost puppet, and long preparing time for performance), it becomes uncompetitive.

In contrast, the soft robotics research community has proposed soft robots that are safe for human environments. The current state of the art enables the creation of small-scale soft robotic devices. In this article we address the gap between small-scale soft robots and the need for human-sized safe robots by introducing a new soft robotic module and multiple human-scale robot configurations based on this module. We tackle large-scale soft robots by presenting a modular and reconfigurable soft robotic platform that can be used to build fully functional and untethered meter-scale soft robots. These findings indicate that a new wave of human-scale soft robots can be an alternative to classic rigid-bodied robots in tasks and environments where humans and machines can work side by side with capabilities that include, but are not limited to, autonomous legged locomotion and grasping.},

This study examines the data collection mode effect on feeling thermometers. Using the 2012 American National Election Studies, we find that the measurement of feeling thermometers is not exactly comparable between face-to-face and Web surveys. Face-to-face respondents tend to provide warmer feelings, while Web respondents give relatively more reliable responses in comparison. In both survey modes, respondents are most likely to select the response options that are verbally labeled although the effect is more striking in face-to-face than Web survey. The item nonresponse between these two modes does not differ in a meaningful way. This study ends by discussing future research directions on feeling thermometer questions.},

The results show that the operation time of the participatory art video development platform is much shorter than that of the control group.

EMG sensors can sense electrical potential from muscles due to finger activation, thus offering rich information for fine-grained finger motion sensing. However converting the sensor information to 3D finger poses is non trivial since signals from multiple fingers superimpose at the sensor in complex patterns. Towards solving this problem, NeuroPose fuses information from anatomical constraints of finger motion with machine learning architectures on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Encoder-Decoder Networks, and ResNets to extract 3D finger motion from noisy EMG data. The generated motion pattern is temporally smooth as well as anatomically consistent. Furthermore, a transfer learning algorithm is leveraged to adapt a pretrained model on one user to a new user with minimal training overhead. A systematic study with 12 users demonstrates a median error of 6.24{\textopenbullet} and a 90\%-ile error of 18.33{\textopenbullet} in tracking 3D finger joint angles. The accuracy is robust to natural variation in sensor mounting positions as well as changes in wrist positions of the user. NeuroPose is implemented on a smartphone with a processing latency of 0.101s, and a low energy overhead.},

  abstract = {This essay examines key aspects of social relationships that were disrupted by the COVID-\-19 pandemic. It focuses explicitly on relational mechanisms of health and brings together theory and emerging evidence on the effects of the COVID-\-19 pandemic to make recommendations for future public health policy and recovery. We first provide an overview of the pandemic in the UK context, outlining the nature of the public health response. We then introduce four distinct domains of social relationships: social networks, social support, social interaction and intimacy, highlighting the mechanisms through which the pandemic and associated public health response drastically altered social interactions in each domain. Throughout the essay, the lens of health inequalities, and perspective of relationships as interconnecting elements in a broader system, is used to explore the varying impact of these disruptions. The essay concludes by providing recommendations for longer term recovery ensuring that the social relational cost of COVID-\-19 is adequately considered in efforts to rebuild.},

We extend this research by exploring whether this effect of VRPT is driven by increased empathy and whether the effect extends to ostensibly real-stakes behavioral games. In a pre-registered laboratory experiment (N = 180), participants interacted with an ostensible partner (a student from the same university as them) on a series of real-stakes economic games after (a) taking the perspective of the partner in a virtual reality, ``day-in-the-life'' simulation, (b) taking the perspective of a different person in a ``day-in-the-life'' simulation, or (c) doing a neutral activity in a virtual environment. The VRPT experience successfully increased participants' subsequent propensity to take the perspective of their partner (a facet of empathy), but only if the partner was the same person whose perspective participants assumed in the virtual reality simulation. Further, this effect of VRPT on perspective-taking was moderated by participants' reported feeling of immersion in the virtual environment. However, we found no effects of VRPT experience on behavior in the economic games.},

Given that both a change in movement behavior and social behavior are an objective in the contexts of aging-in-place, neurocognitive and neurophysical rehabilitation, and depression, these key mechanisms should also be included in the interaction with social companion robots in therapy and care. We give an overview on the two concepts ranging from a social neuroscience over a behavioral towards a sociological perspective and argue that both concepts affect each other and are up to now only marginally applied in human--robot interaction.},

The marginal likelihood (aka Bayesian evidence), which represents the probability of generating our observations from a prior, provides a distinctive approach to this foundational question, automatically encoding Occam's razor. Although it has been observed that the marginal likelihood can overfit and is sensitive to prior assumptions, its limitations for hyperparameter learning and discrete model comparison have not been thoroughly investigated. We first revisit the appealing properties of the marginal likelihood for learning constraints and hypothesis testing. We then highlight the conceptual and practical issues in using the marginal likelihood as a proxy for generalization. Namely, we show how marginal likelihood can be negatively correlated with generalization, with implications for neural architecture search, and can lead to both underfitting and overfitting in hyperparameter learning. We provide a partial remedy through a conditional marginal likelihood, which we show is more aligned with generalization, and practically valuable for large-scale hyperparameter learning, such as in deep kernel learning.},

A broad distinction between benevolence and activism serves as the foundation to explore forms of intergroup prosociality, such as charitable giving, displays of empathy and affirmation (positive and supportive contact), allyship, and solidarity. Gaps and implications for future research are discussed. For example, we propose that it may be useful to distinguish allyship, defined as advocacy for others motivated by the values and norms of the ingroup for its own ends, from solidarity, defined as advocacy on behalf of others from the perspective of a shared, inclusive group. We propose that articulating the similarities between these various forms of intergroup prosociality, and testing the differences, will be a useful direction of future research.},

Despite their promise, these actuators can be difficult to both design and fabricate. As a solution, we present a workflow for computationally designing and digitally fabricating soft pneumatic actuators via a machine knitting process. Machine knitting is attractive as a fabrication process because it is fast, digital (programmable), and provides access to a rich material library of functional yarns for specified mechanical behavior and integrated sensing. Our method uses elastic stitches to construct non-homogeneous knitting structures, which program the bending of actuators when inflated. Our method also integrates pressure and swept frequency capacitive sensing structures using conductive yarns. The entire knitted structure is fabricated automatically in a single machine run. We further provide a computational design interface for the user to interactively preview actuators' quasi-static shape when authoring elastic stitches. Our sensing-integrated actuators are cost-effective, easy to design, robust to large actuation, and require minimal manual post-processing. We demonstrate five use-cases of our actuators in relevant application settings.},

  abstract = {The surge of interest about mindfulness meditation is associated with a growing empirical evidence about its impact on the mind and body. Yet, despite promising phenomenological or psychological models of mindfulness, a general mechanistic understanding of meditation steeped in neuroscience is still lacking. In parallel, predictive processing approaches to the mind are rapidly developing in the cognitive sciences with an impressive explanatory power: processes apparently as diverse as perception, action, attention, and learning, can be seen as unfolding and being coherently orchestrated according to the single general mandate of free-energy minimization. Here, we briefly explore the possibility to supplement previous phenomenological models of focused attention meditation by formulating them in terms of active inference. We first argue that this perspective can account for how paying voluntary attention to the body in meditation helps settling the mind by downweighting habitual and automatic trajectories of (pre)motor and autonomic reactions, as well as the pull of distracting spontaneous thought at the same time. Secondly, we discuss a possible relationship between phenomenological notions such as opacity and de-reification, and the deployment of precision-weighting via the voluntary allocation of attention. We propose the adoption of this theoretical framework as a promising strategy for contemplative research. Explicit computational simulations and comparisons with experimental and phenomenological data will be critical to fully develop this approach.},

Mindfulness meditation practices can be conceptualized as a set of attention-based, regulatory, and self-inquiry training regimes cultivated for various ends, including wellbeing and psychological health. This article examines the construct of mindfulness in psychological research and reviews recent, nonclinical work in this area. Instead of proposing a single definition of mindfulness, we interpret it as a continuum of practices involving states and processes that can be mapped into a multidimensional phenomenological matrix which itself can be expressed in a neurocognitive framework. This phenomenological matrix of mindfulness is presented as a heuristic to guide formulation of next-generation research hypotheses from both cognitive/behavioral and neuroscientific perspectives. In relation to this framework, we review selected findings on mindfulness cultivated through practices in traditional and research settings, and we conclude by identifying significant gaps in the literature and outline new directions for research.},

After 3 months of twice weekly two hours improvisation sessions, 29 one-hour interviews with participants were undertaken, recorded, transcribed, and analysed. Key themes include how the sessions helped participants stay connected, provided opportunities for artistic development, enhanced mood, reduced feelings of isolation, had a positive effect on mood and sustained and developed community. Particular attention is placed upon how improvisation as a universal, real time, social, collaborative process facilitates interaction allowing the technological affordances of software (latencies, sound quality, gallery/speaker view) and hardware (laptop, tablet, instruments, microphones, headphones, objects in room) to become emergent properties of artistic collaborations. The extent to which this process affects new perceptual and conceptual breakthroughs for practitioners is discussed as is the crucial and innovative relationship between audio and visual elements. Analysis of edited films of the sessions highlight artistic and theoretical and conceptual issues discussed.

  abstract = {The outcomes of social interactions among members of different groups (e.g., racial groups, political groups, sexual orientation groups) have long been of interest to psychologists. Two related literatures on the topic have emerged---the intergroup interaction literature and the intergroup contact literature---in which divergent conclusions have been reported. Intergroup interaction is typically found to have negative effects tied to intergroup bias, producing heightened stress, intergroup anxiety, or outgroup avoidance, whereas intergroup contact is typically found to have positive effects tied to intergroup bias, predicting lower intergroup anxiety and lower prejudice. We examine these paradoxical findings, proposing that researchers contributing to the two literatures are examining different levels of the same phenomenon and that methodological differences can account for the divide between the literatures. Further, we introduce a mathematical model by which the findings of the two literatures can be reconciled. We believe that adopting this model will streamline thinking in the field and will generate integrative new research in which investigators examine how a person's experiences with diversity unfold.},

Our analysis reveals some surprising formal similarities between the two frameworks, and suggests interesting lines of future research.

Sometimes these projects generate unprecedented solutions; sometimes they converge on common goals and realize larger transformations. As Ezio Manzini describes in this book, we are witnessing a wave of social innovations as these changes unfold - an expansive open co-design process in which new solutions are suggested and new meanings are created. Manzini distinguishes between diffuse design (performed by everybody) and expert design (performed by those who have been trained as designers) and describes how they inteact. He maps what design experts can do to trigger and support meaningful social changes, focusing on emerging forms of collaboration. These range from community-supported argiculture in China to digital platforms for medical care in Canada; from interactive storytelling in India to collaborative housing in Milan. These cases illustrate how expert designers can support such collaborations - making their existence more probable, their practice easer, their diffusion and their convergence in larger projects more effective. Manzini draws the first comprehensive picture of design for social innovation: the most dynamic field of action for both expert and nonexpert designers in the coming decades. -- from dust jacket},

This article focuses on such reconciliation-aimed intergroup encounters between Israeli Jews and Palestinians that seek to reduce hostility and increase understanding and cooperation between the two nationalities. Like other contact interventions conducted in settings of intergroup conflict, encounters between Israeli Jews and Palestinians represent a paradoxical project: this is a project that aspires to generate equality and cooperation between groups that are embedded in a protracted asymmetrical conflict. Though existing research teaches us valuable lessons on the effectiveness of contact conducted under optimal conditions, little is said about contact between groups involved in asymmetrical protracted dispute. The goal of this analysis is to examine the evolution of reconciliation-aimed contact interventions between Israeli Jews and Palestinians in the past 20 years. The research method is qualitative, relying on ethnographic data assembled during the relevant period of time. The findings identify and trace the evolution of four major models of Jewish--Palestinian planned encounters: the Coexistence Model, the Joint Projects Model, the Confrontational Model, and the Narrative-Story-Telling Model. The strengths and limitations of each model in transforming intergroup attitudes in asymmetric conflict are discussed.},

This approach assesses the extent to which contact interventions, aimed at improving relations between sides in dispute, actually promote among their participants relationships, behaviors, and interactions that fulfill standards of social justice, equality, and fairness. Creating equality in communication models and reinforces values of mutual respect and tolerance. Thus, establishing symmetrical communication can be especially important for many interventions conducted to resolve conflicts marked by unequal distribution of power. One such asymmetrical conflict is the one between the Jewish majority and the Arab minority in Israel. This article describes a study that applies our process-evaluation approach to assess equality and social justice in planned contact interventions between Israeli Jews and Arabs by measuring the degree to which members of the two groups contributed equally to the communication between them. Finally, the article presents guidelines, derived from this and other similar studies, for establishing communication equality in other planned contact interventions.},

  abstract = {This study presents a framework for conceptualizing processes of interaction and communication within structured encounters between groups in conflict. It is based on the assumption that such encounters essentially reflect or are influenced by the external reality of conflict. As such, they are likely to be characterized by multiple interacting conflicts (Bar-On, 1997); by disputes over goals, agendas, and the expression of group identities; and by patterns of influence and control. This paradigm was used to analyze a case of structured coexistence encounters between Jews and Palestinians in Israel. The analysis of the processes and the dynamics of these encounters reveals a configuration of groups, subgroups, and coalitions that evolved around the central dispute over the encounters' agenda. This dispute reflected and interacted with the ethnonational conflict between Jews and Palestinians. It appears that the notion of cooperation so successfully employed in Sherif's (1966) study acquired a different meaning when transposed to a setting of unofficial third-party intervention in a genuine ethnonational conflict. Like similar agendas promoting coexistence and cooperation, the official agenda forwarded by the Jewish management of joint pedagogical activity was perceived by the Palestinian participants as an attempt to prevent the minority from expressing its national identity and demands for recognition. The power struggles that revolved around this dispute over the agenda are described, and the implications of the paradigm for the theory and practice of interventions aimed at fostering coexistence and peace building are discussed.}

The present research raises a fundamental question regarding these interventions of ``is there contact at all?'' Based on previous research and observations, we claim that the occurrence of intergroup interactions in planned contact interventions between groups in conflict can subject to marked variability. Thus, this study's goal is to construct and apply a measure assessing the extent of intergroup interaction in such interventions. The data was collected through observations of planned encounters between Jews and Arabs that were conducted in Israel in 1999--2000. The findings show variability in the extent of intergroup interaction in the investigated programs. While the majority of these encounters (Some 65\% of them) were characterized by a high extent of intergroup interaction, some 20\% of them contained a medium level of interaction and some 15\% a low level one. The findings further indicate that programs targeted at high school students and adults were characterized by higher levels of intergroup interaction while programs targeted at preschool to fourth grade children and especially programs targeted at fifth to ninth graders included a lower extent of such interaction. Theoretical and practical implication of these findings are discussed. r 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Your situation with Nazis that caused you pain and harm is the exact same situation that we have, and this is why I cannot befriend Jews, with what they do to us as we live in this state". From this point forward the dialogue became highly destructive, with reciprocal exchanges of verbal attacks Through a critical examination of the processes that led up to verbal violence, we hope to contribute to the understanding of intergroup hatred and aggression on both the micro and macro levels of socio-political relations between the sides.

To this end, we show how performing identity on a particular social media has consequences in terms of further attempts to elaborate personal identity within the same social medium, across social media and ``offline''. We contribute to the sociomateriality literature which examines social media use seen as an enactment between human and material agency.},

Here we used different conducting yarns (polyamide+carbon, silicon+carbon, polyamide+silver coated, cellulose+carbon, polyester+2 {\texttimes} INOX 50 {$\mu$}m, polyester+2 {\texttimes} Cu/Sn and polyester+gold coated) to develop such textile actuators. It was possible to coat them through direct electrochemical methods, which should provide with an easier and more cost-effective fabrication process. The conductivity and the electrochemical properties of the yarns were sufficient to allow the electropolymerization of the conducting polymer polypyrrole on the yarns. The electropolymerization was carried out and both the linear and angular the actuation of the yarns was investigated. These yarns may be incorporated into textile actuators for assistive prosthetic devices easier and cheaper to get and at the same time with good mechanical performance are envisaged.},

The objective of this investigation focuses on the study of variables that can a ect the acceptance of robots by the Portuguese public. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) is applied to understand the in uence of a set of sociodemographic variables, travel behavior, motivation, and attitude towards technology in general in the perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness of using robots in tourism. The results obtained demonstrate that the Portuguese case is similar to that of other Western countries, with gender, age, travel group, motivation and attitude towards technology having a signi cant impact on the dependent variables.},

There are debilitating consequences of social isolation and loneliness, and social support is increasingly a primary consideration in health care, disease prevention, and recovery. Considering social connection as an ``innate need,'' it is hypothesized that evolutionarily conserved neural systems underlie the maintenance of social connections: alerting the individual to their absence and coordinating effector mechanisms to restore social contact. This is reminiscent of a homeostatic system designed to maintain social connection. Here, we explore the identity of neural systems regulating ``social homeostasis.'' We review findings from rodent studies evaluating the rapid response to social deficit (in the form of acute social isolation) and propose that parallel, overlapping circuits are engaged to adapt to the vulnerabilities of isolation and restore social connection. By considering the neural systems regulating other homeostatic needs, such as energy and fluid balance, we discuss the potential attributes of social homeostatic circuitry. We reason that uncovering the identity of these circuits/mechanisms will facilitate our understanding of how loneliness perpetuates long-term disease states, which we speculate may result from sustained recruitment of social homeostatic circuits.},

For the first time, the current study examines the effectiveness of a contemporary intergroup contact strategy, called electronic or E-contact, to reduce stigma against people diagnosed with schizophrenia. It also examines the mediating role of three target-relevant intergroup emotions, namely fear, anger, and pity. In total, 133 participants engaged in E-contact with a person diagnosed with schizophrenia (intergroup E-contact), E-contact with a person without a mental illness (intragroup E-contact), or no contact. Compared to the intragroup E-contact and no-contact conditions, intergroup E-contact reduced fear, anger, and stereotyping toward people with schizophrenia. Additionally, fear and anger, but not pity, were found to be significant affective mediators of the E-contact effect. The findings demonstrate the value of computer-mediated intergroup contact for stigma reduction, and emphasize the importance of intergroup emotions in this domain.},

The current study seeks to investigate kindergarten children's attitudes towards homosexuality and how they are influenced by their peer-groups and authorities. It does so by means of a puppet theatre presentation including `Kasperl' and `Seppel' puppets as the main protagonists in a German puppet theatre. The audience consisted of six German kindergarten children aged 4--6~years, randomly selected by the kindergarten director. A participant observation has been conducted with the first researcher as the presenter of the puppet show. The results of the recorded puppet theatre showed that several intragroup processes including the social identity theory with regard to group membership could be observed within the puppet theatre. Groups have been formed and children of the same ingroup showed equal attitudes towards homosexuality. However, the researcher's influence as an authority figure could have as well impacted their attitudes through positive reinforcement. The present study contributed to the gap in research regarding kindergarten children's attitudes towards homosexuality. To have a better overview of the results, future studies should include additional variables like kindergarten's cultural and geographical differences.},

Thus, in order to enable effective international customization of robot designs, and in order to facilitate their smoother harmonious introduction to everyday life, it is important to study the opinions and attitudes toward robots in different regions of the world. Although there exists a small body of research covering the US, EU, and Asia, there is almost no research regarding attitudes toward robots in the Middle East, a region with its own marked cultural idiosyncrasies. Therefore, we brought Ibn Sina, an Arabic-language conversational android robot to Dubai's Gitex, one of the most important exhibitions in the region, and performed a questionnaire-based empirical study with 355 subjects from 38 countries, which had seen the robot interacting, and most of which had also interacted directly with it. Many interesting findings are presented: First, a statistically significant ordering of preferred application areas for robots overall was found, as well as strong effects of the region of origin on the preferred applications. Furthermore, strong religion, age, and education effects were observed. Overall, the results together with a theoretical discussion of possible causes provide interesting insights on cultural acceptance of robots in this richly complex region, which potentially have strong implications to their wider deployment in the future in specific settings.},

By combining one of humankind's oldest technologies, textile processing, with electroactive polymers, we demonstrate here the feasibility of wearable, soft artificial muscles made by weaving and knitting, with tunable force and strain. These textile actuators were produced from cellulose yarns assembled into fabrics and coated with conducting polymers using a metal-free deposition. To increase the output force, we assembled yarns in parallel by weaving. The force scaled linearly with the number of yarns in the woven fabric. To amplify the strain, we knitted a stretchable fabric, exhibiting a 53-fold increase in strain. In addition, the textile construction added mechanical stability to the actuators. Textile processing permits scalable and rational production of wearable artificial muscles, and enables novel ways to design assistive devices. Textile artificial muscles were developed using weaving to increase the force and knitting to amplify the strain. Textile artificial muscles were developed using weaving to increase the force and knitting to amplify the strain.},

To date, introductions to this theory have proved difficult for many readers to follow, but it depends mainly upon two relatively simple ideas: firstly that normative or teleological values can be expressed as probability distributions (active inference), and secondly that approximate Bayesian reasoning can be effectively performed by gradient descent on model parameters (the freeenergy principle). The notion of active inference is of great interest for a number of disciplines including cognitive science and artificial intelligence, as well as cognitive neuroscience, and deserves to be more widely known. This paper attempts to provide an accessible introduction to active inference and informational free-energy, for readers from a range of scientific backgrounds. In this work introduce an agent-based model with an agent trying to make predictions about its position in a one-dimensional discretized world using methods from the FEP.},

In this paper we examine two axes of diversity: gender, and geographic location (of both authors and conferences) and examine how they affect participation at major HCI conferences. Diversity in a group is associated with better outcomes from its work, and HCI has made numerous contributions to increasing representation in other communities. Reflecting on our own situation can produce recommendations for the planning of future HCI conferences, and identify challenges of representation that the HCI community should endeavor to address.},

It is now well established that intergroup contact can improve attitudes not only toward the out-group as a whole but also toward other, noncontacted groups (secondary transfer effect). We review evidence of a further, higher-order generalization effect whereby intergroup contact also impacts more general cognitive processes outside of the intergroup context (i.e., tertiary transfer effects). We present a taxonomy of transfer effects that explains these generalization effects as distinct outcomes of the contact process yet contingent on the same component process, specifically, the assessment of the semantic distance between the target (e.g., contacted individual) and the frame (e.g., group prototype). This conceptualization provides an explanatory framework for uniting the disparate forms of transfer effect in the contact literature, clarifying why primary and secondary transfer effects are facilitated by low semantic distance and why contact is more cognitively demanding under conditions of high semantic distance, but with greater potential for cognitive growth.},

In this paper, we show that the requirement of absolute continuity is necessary: we describe a simple yet prototypical counterexample showing that in the more realistic case of distributions that are not absolutely continuous, unregularized GAN training is not always convergent. Furthermore, we discuss regularization strategies that were recently proposed to stabilize GAN training. Our analysis shows that GAN training with instance noise or zerocentered gradient penalties converges. On the other hand, we show that Wasserstein-GANs and WGAN-GP with a finite number of discriminator updates per generator update do not always converge to the equilibrium point. We discuss these results, leading us to a new explanation for the stability problems of GAN training. Based on our analysis, we extend our convergence results to more general GANs and prove local convergence for simplified gradient penalties even if the generator and data distributions lie on lower dimensional manifolds. We find these penalties to work well in practice and use them to learn highresolution generative image models for a variety of datasets with little hyperparameter tuning.},

Taking as its premise the idea that virtual reality can help make sense of the world around us and influence our comprehension of reality, In the Land of the Unreal considers the global reality crisis that permeates anxieties emergent in VR development.

In particular, users most enhance on physical attributes that they perceive to be weak in real life. We also find that avatar attractiveness affects online behavioral traits such as extroversion and loudness. Lastly, we find support for a hierarchy of physical variation across online roles whereby people retain core identity elements (such as gender and race) across all their avatars, but they change peripheral elements (such as hair and clothing, and even face). We conclude by discussing implications of our findings for business and society.},

  abstract = {" This book draws inspiration from Maurice Merleau-Ponty's concept of intercorporeality to offer a new, multidisciplinary perspective on the body. By drawing attention to the body's ability to simultaneously sense and be sensed, Merleau-Ponty transcends the object-subject divide and describes how bodies are about, into, and within other bodies. Such inherent relationality constitutes the essence of intercorporeality, and the chapters in this book examine such relationality from a host of diverse perspectives. The book begins with an introductory chapter in which the editors review the current research on bodily interaction, and introduce the notion of intercorporeality as a potentially integrative framework. The first section then offers four chapters devoted to clarifying theoretical and developmental perspectives on intercorporeality. Section 2 contains three chapters that provide insight on intercorporeality from evolutionary, historical, and cross-sectional perspectives. In Section 3, four chapters examine the intercorporeal nature of meaning-making during human interaction. Section 4 then presents three chapters that explore the intercorporeal nature of multi-agent interactions and the role that non-animate bodies (i.e., objects) play in such interaction. Throughout all the chapters, the authors work to integrate research in their specific discipline into the larger, transdisciplinary notion of intercorporeality. This collection provides an indisputably unique perspective on bodies-in-interaction, while simultaneously offering an interdisciplinary way forward in contemporary scholarship on bodies, meaning, and interaction.

While the peace process between the Palestinians and Israelis has started, no final solution has been reached between the two sides, and Israel still occupies most of the Palestinian territories in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Under these conditions, an interesting question is raised about normalization between Palestinians and Israelis. Based on data collected in 1994 from a total sample of 270 students in Birzeit University, this article studies the attitudes of Palestinian students toward cultural normalization with Israel. Despite the fact that Israel still occupies the Palestinian territories, a major part of Palestinian students support normalizing cultural relations between Palestinians and Israelis. Support for normalization is significantly associated with social class or father's occupation. Students from the working class are more supportive of cultural cooperation with Israelis than those from other classes. This is explained by the working-class families' greater experience of contact with Israelis and a greater dependence on the Israeli labour market.},

We report findings from four design workshops with 31 pro-choice stakeholders across Ireland in which we positioned an exploratory protosite, HerStoryTold, to engender critical conversations around the use of sensitive abortion narratives as a tool for engagement. Our analysis shows how digital storytelling can help reject false narratives and raise awareness of the realities of abortion laws. It suggests design directions to curate narratives that provoke empathy, foster polyvocality, and ultimately expand the engaged community. Furthermore, this research calls for designers to actively support community mobilization through providing `stepping stones' to activism.},

Furthermore, for both studies these effects are significantly mediated by intergroup emotions, above and beyond measures of stereotypes (stereotype endorsement in Study 1 and stereotype knowledge in Study 2) that were entered as alternative potential mediators. Stereotype endorsement also plays a significant mediational role in one case.

It elaborates the conceptual meaning of key concepts: intergroup salience, typicality of an outgroup member, decategorization, differentiation, and personalization. In particular, the article argues for the conceptual independence of differentiation (individuation) among social category members and personalized interaction (self-disclosure and self/other comparison) with category members. A hypothetical experiment is presented to illustrate the independent operationalization of the two constructs. Stronger benefits are expected for the latter. Whereas the benefits of differentiation primarily rest on cognitive effects, personalization also has motivational consequences: justifying one's self-disclosure and inducing increased trust.},

Despite its importance, the mathematical origins of this quantity and its relation to the variational free energy (VFE) remain unclear. In this letter, we investigate the origins of the EFE in detail and show that it is not simply ''the free energy in the future.'' We present a functional that we argue is the natural extension of the VFE but actively discourages exploratory behavior, thus demonstrating that exploration does not directly follow from free energy minimization into the future. We then develop a novel objective, the free energy of the expected future (FEEF), which possesses both the epistemic component of the EFE and an intuitive mathematical grounding as the divergence between predicted and desired futures.},

We design and pilot a distinctive drama-based approach to conflict transformation that we call Forum Theatre for Reconciliation (FTR). The method furthers embodied intersubjective understanding as well as a critical analysis of structural causes of conflict. We discuss this approach applied to low-intensity communal conflicts linked to extreme wildfires in Bolivia, where fires exacerbate tensions between different communities and result in (sometimes) violent confrontation and polarising discourse. We identify three key innovations of this peacebuilding approach: rehumanising the Self and Other, co-creating complex and inclusive narratives of conflict, and devising collective response across different perspectives and experiences.},

In particular, he hypothesized that a person's response to a humanlike robot would abruptly shift from empathy to revulsion as it approached, but failed to attain, a lifelike appearance. This descent into eeriness is known as the uncanny valley. The essay appeared in an obscure Japanese journal called Energy in 1970, and in subsequent years, it received almost no attention. However, more recently, the concept of the uncanny valley has rapidly attracted interest in robotics and other scientific circles as well as in popular culture. Some researchers have explored its implications for human-robot interaction and computer-graphics animation, whereas others have investigated its biological and social roots. Now interest in the uncanny valley should only intensify, as technology evolves and researchers build robots that look human. Although copies of Mori's essay have circulated among researchers, a complete version hasn't been widely available. The following is the first publication of an English translation that has been authorized and reviewed by Mori. (See ``Turning Point'' in this issue for an interview with Mori.).},

I answer this question by randomly assigning Iraqi Christians displaced by ISIS either to an all-Christian soccer team or to a team mixed with Muslims. I find persistent changes to behaviors: Christians assigned to mixed teams are 12 percentage points more likely to attend a social event open to Muslims, 54 percentage points more likely to train with Muslims six months after the intervention ends, and 25 percentage points more likely to vote for a Muslim player to receive a sportsmanship award. These results seem to be driven by changing norms around social contact as well as a positive experience, with top-performing teams being more likely to patronize a restaurant in Muslim-dominated Mosul. The impact on personal beliefs, however, was mixed. These findings point to the potential for positive and cooperative contact across social lines to build tolerant behaviors after conflict --- even if underlying prejudice remains unchanged.},

However, empirical support for the effectiveness of these methods is mixed at best. Here, we propose that intergroup attitudes tend to be highly resistant to change, and thus, any method aiming to change these attitudes will be effective only if it successfully overcomes this resistance. First, we argue that traditional methods used to promote positive intergroup attitudes are inadequate in this regard. Next, we suggest that narratives are a unique way of overcoming resistance because they create less reactance, transport individuals into a story world, and provide them with social models. We then describe empirical evidence suggesting that narratives are likely to be particularly useful for creating more positive attitudes toward members of other social groups. Finally, we propose a number of empirical and theoretical questions that present challenges for research on narratives and intergroup attitudes.},

Drawing on thematic analysis of accounts of paid domestic labour and food-sharing practices, we argue that negative contact experiences may cumulatively engender a sense of dehumanization and associated feelings of humiliation: a response marked by intertwined constructions of shame and injustice. Implications for understanding wider problems of intergroup conflict and political solidarity are discussed and avenues for future research proposed.},

Processes of globalization increasingly depend upon information and communication technologies (ICTs), and these normally need modifications to fit local contexts. This requires that processes that affect interactions between global, regional, and local levels need to be understood. It appears reasonable to conjecture that understanding the roles or effects of socioeconomic and cultural factors (among others) would lead to more effective ICT policies for sustainable development at regional and local levels. Drawing on Sen's capability theory of human development, a modified version of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) is presented, and validated by analyzing survey data gathered in two sub-Saharan African countries, although no claim is made as to the model's generalizability. Some diagnostics and prescriptions for how to effect sustainable technology adoption and development across the region to enhance human capabilities are then presented.

Through a 6-month long qualitative, empirical study we examine the prevalent beliefs and practices around maternal health in Pakistan, the access women have to health-care, the existing religious practices that influence them and the agency they exert in their own health-care decision making. We reveal the rampant misinformation among mothers and health workers, house-hold power dynamics that impact maternal health and the deep link between maternal health and religious beliefs. We also show how current maternal health care interventions fit poorly into this context and discuss alternate design recommendations for meeting the maternal health needs of these women.},

It suggests that when the high status group provides to the low status group dependency oriented help, it may do so in order to establish dominance. The willing receptivity of the low status group may indicate its acceptance of the inequality, and lack of receptivity for such help may be motivated by the desire to achieve social equality.

  abstract = {The present study explores the effects of expressions of empathy for the ingroup's conflict-related suffering and assumed responsibility for causing it by a representative of the rival outgroup on recipient's willingness for reconciliation. It is suggested that such positive expressions by an adversary will have positive effects on reconciliation only in the presence of a basic level of trust in the outgroup. In two studies, Israeli-Jewish participants were exposed to a Palestinian leader who either expressed or did not express empathy and/or Palestinian responsibility for Israelis' suffering. After reading the speech, participants completed a questionnaire that measured their attitudes toward reconciliation with Palestinians. Results of both studies show that whereas expression of empathy led to more positive attitudes when trust was high, it tended to have adverse effects when trust was low. Similar effects were not found for assumed responsibility. Implications for research on intergroup conflict and reconciliation are discussed.},

Seventy-six students took part in a collaborative online course during one academic year connecting Jews and Arabs in Israel. They marked their perceived distance to their team members at the beginning and end of the course using the novel Team Circles tool. Initially both Arab and Jewish students felt closer to their in-group team members. However, perceived distances decreased significantly over time with Arab students reporting equal perceived distances to their in-group and out-group members after the course. The results from the Team Circles test were combined with repeated measures of intergroup attitudes using Implicit Association Tests. Although no significant changes in intergroup attitudes were observed, greater reduction in perceived distances to out-group team members resulted in lower levels of prejudice toward the out-group as a whole after the course.},

Traditionally, such systems are asymmetric in nature where only one side (participant) is ``teleported'' to the remote location. In this manuscript, the authors explore the possibility of symmetric three-dimensional telepresence where both sides (participants) are ``teleported'' simultaneously to each other's location; the overarching concept of symmetric telepresence in virtual environments is extended to telepresence robots in physical environments. Two identical physical humanoid robots located in UK and the USA serve as surrogates while performing a transcontinental shared collaborative task. The actions of these surrogate robots are driven by capturing the intent of the participants controlling them in either location. Participants could communicate verbally but could not see the other person or the remote location while performing the task. The effectiveness of gesturing along with other observations during this preliminary experiment is presented. Results reveal that the symmetric robotic telepresence allowed participants to use and understand gestures in cases where they would otherwise have to describe their actions verbally.

  abstract = {This paper presents a framework to interactively control avatars in remote environments. The system, called AMITIES, serves as the central component that connects people controlling avatars (inhabiters), various manifestations of these avatars (surrogates), and people interacting with these avatars (participants). A multiserver--client architecture, based on a low-demand network protocol, connects the participant environment(s), the inhabiter station(s), and the avatars. A human-in-the-loop metaphor provides an interface for remote operation, with support for multiple inhabiters, multiple avatars, and multiple participants. Custom animation blending routines and a gesture-based interface provide inhabiters with an intuitive avatar control paradigm. This gesture control is enhanced by genres of program-controlled behaviors that can be triggered by events or inhabiter choices for individual or groups of avatars. This mixed (agency and gesture-based) control paradigm reduces the cognitive and physical loads on the inhabiter while supporting natural bidirectional conversation between participants and the virtual characters or avatar counterparts, including ones with physical manifestations, for example, robotic surrogates. The associated system affords the delivery of personalized experiences that adapt to the actions and interactions of individual users, while staying true to each virtual character's personality and backstory. In addition to its avatar control paradigm, AMITIES provides processes for character and scenario development, testing, and refinement. It also has integrated capabilities for session recording and event tagging, along with automated tools for reflection and after-action review. We demonstrate effectiveness by describing an instantiation of AMITIES, called TeachLivE, that is widely used by colleges of education to prepare new teachers and provide continuing professional development to existing teachers. Finally, we show the system's flexibility by describing a number of other diverse applications, and presenting plans to enhance capabilities and application areas.},

  abstract = {The notion of immersive witness underpins much of the exploration of virtual reality (VR) by journalists and humanitarian organisations. Immersive witness links the experience of VR with a moral attitude of responsibility for distant others. In accounts of media witness, the ability of the media to sustain an experience of presence has played an important, albeit often implicit, role linking the spectator spatially and temporally to distant suffering. However, the concept of media witness has to date assumed that the media represent, that news stories and documentaries present to their audiences images and sounds that communicate something of an event. VR, in contrast, seeks to simulate, providing the audience with something of an experience that is linked in various ways to the experiences of others. It is this simulative function that is seen as fundamental to VR's moral address. This paper explores the moral potential of VR suggesting that while there is much to recommend VR as a platform for humanitarian communication there is an inherent moral risk attached: the risk of improper distance. The United Nation's VR work serves as a case study for exploring VR's moral potential and the risk of improper distance.},

We describe the design and fabrication of the actuator, provide an analytical model of the torque, and characterize the actuator performance. The actuator is made with different sizes to be used in a large range of applications such as robotic hands, robotic arms, and wearable soft exosuits. Five actuators were attached to a commercial glove fingers and form a wearable glove, the glove shows different gestures and it is able to hold 9 kg weights. With a larger scale, the bending actuator was able to hold 20 kg. In addition, a preliminary experiment shows a reduction of 50\% in EMG signals reflecting muscle activities during 9 kg weight bar grasping and releasing stages.},

In this paper we propose an online programming of behaviour of a soft textile inflatable actuator. Four strings are attached to the tip of the actuator and travelling through its longitudinal axis to the fixed side where they are pulled with different tension forces. The applied forces on all strings define the actuator behaviour when inflated. Bending in different directions, twisting, and elongation behaviours were generated online by varying the strings pulling forces and the air pressure of the actuator.},

  abstract = {Drawing upon subaltern geopolitics and feminist geography, this article explores how militarisation shapes micro-geographies of violence and occupation in Israel--Palestine. While accounts of spectacular and large-scale political violence dominate popular imaginaries and academic analyses in/of the region, a shift to the micro-scale foregrounds the relationship between power, politics and space at the level of everyday life. In the context of Israel--Palestine, micro-geographies have revealed dynamic strategies for `getting by' or `dealing with' the occupation, as practiced by Palestinian populations in the face of spatialised violence. However, this article considers how Jewish Israelis actively shape the spatial micro-politics of power within and along the borders of the Israeli state. Based on 12 months of ethnographic research in Tel Aviv and West Jerusalem during 2010--2011, an analysis of everyday narratives illustrates how relations of violence, occupation and domination rely upon gendered dynamics of border collapse and boundary maintenance. Here, the borders between home front and battlefield break down at the same time as communal boundaries are reproduced, generating conditions of `total militarism' wherein military interests and agendas are both actively and passively diffused. Through gendering the militarised micro-geographies of violence among Jewish Israelis, this article reveals how individuals construct, navigate and regulate the everyday spaces of occupation, detailing more precisely how macro political power endures. Bas{\'a}ndose en la geopol{\'i}tica subalterna y la geograf{\'i}a feminista, este art{\'i}culo explora c{\'o}mo la militarizaci{\'o}n da forma a las microgeograf{\'i}as de violencia y ocupaci{\'o}n en Israel-Palestina. Mientras los relatos de espectacular violencia pol{\'i}tica de gran escala dominan los imaginarios populares y los an{\'a}lisis acad{\'e}micos sobre la regi{\'o}n y dentro de la misma, un cambio hacia la microescala destaca la relaci{\'o}n entre poder, pol{\'i}tica y espacio a nivel de la vida cotidiana. En el contexto de Israel-Palestina, las microgeograf{\'i}as han revelado las estrategias din{\'a}micas para `aguantar' o `lidiar' con la ocupaci{\'o}n, utilizadas por las poblaciones palestinas de cara a la violencia espacializada. Sin embargo, este art{\'i}culo considera c{\'o}mo los jud{\'i}os israel{\'i}es dan forma activamente a la micropol{\'i}tica espacial de poder dentro y a lo largo de las fronteras del estado israel{\'i}. Basado en doce meses de investigaci{\'o}n etnogr{\'a}fica en Tel Aviv y Jerusal{\'e}n Oeste durante 2010--2011, un an{\'a}lisis de narrativas cotidianas ilustra c{\'o}mo las relaciones de violencia, ocupaci{\'o}n y dominaci{\'o}n se basan en din{\'a}micas generizadas de colapso de fronteras y mantenimiento de l{\'i}mites.

Assuming that science can make it happen, the question becomes: should we make it happen? Is it morally permissible to create synthetic beings with consciousness? While a consequentialist approach may seem logical, attempting to assess the potential positive and negative consequences of such a revolutionary technology is highly speculative and raises more questions than it answers. Accordingly, some turn to ancient and not-so-ancient stories of ``automata'' for direction. Of the many automata conjured throughout history, if not in matter then in mind, the Golem stands out as one of the most persistent paradigms employed to discuss technology in general and technologically engendered life forms in particular. In this essay, I introduce a novel reading of the Golem paradigm to argue not from consequentialism, but from a deep-seated two-thousand-year-old tradition, the ethical implications of which are wholly deontological.},

We have deployed and studied the use of telepresence robots at three ACM conferences, Ubicomp/ISWC 2014, CSCW 2016, and CHI 2016, ranging from remote users having dedicated telepresence robots to users sharing telepresence robots both synchronously and asynchronously. In this article, we report on the telepresence offerings along with the user behaviors, experiences, and the social norms found for remote conference attendance. Our results across the studies focus around three main themes: shared vs. dedicated robot usage, identity presentation and the value and challenges associated with it; and local in-person support through proxies and instant messaging backchannels. These themes point to three different areas of design exploration for telepresence robots, pointing out the limitations of existing design solutions with respect to each theme, areas for future telepresence design work, and the value in considering varied telepresence robot solutions, including both dedicated and shared telepresence robots.},

We argue that careful design based on an understanding of non-verbal communication can mitigate these differences. In this paper, we study the effects of video image framing in one-on-one meetings on empathy formation. We alter the video image by framing the display such that, in one condition, only the head is visible while, in the other condition, the entire upper body is visible. We include a F2F control case. We used two measures of dyad empathy and found a significant difference between head-only framing and both upper-body framing and F2F, but no significant difference between upper-body framing and F2F. Based on these and earlier results, we present some design heuristics for video conferencing systems. We revisit earlier negative experimental results on video systems in the light of these new experiments. We conclude that for systems that preserve both gaze and upper-body cues, there is no evidence of deficit in communication effectiveness compared to face-to-face meetings.},

It does so by outlining a vocabulary and strategy that make up a framework for theorizing work and organizational practices. The vocabulary is based on number of sensitizing concepts that connote practice as an open-ended, heterogeneous accomplishment which takes place within a specific horizon of sense and a set of concerns which the practice itself brings to bear. The strategy is based on the metaphorical movement of `zooming in' and `zooming out of' practice. The zooming in and out are obtained through switching theoretical lenses and re-positioning in the field, so that certain aspects of the practice are foregrounded while others are bracketed. Building on the results of an extended study of telemedicine, the article discusses in detail the different elements of the framework and how it enhances our capacity to re-present practice. The article concludes with some considerations on how the proposed approach can assist us in advancing the research agenda of organizational and work studies.},

We find that VR influences social attitudes significantly more than non-immersive interventions, while embodiment has no moderation effect. Further, outgroup VR perspective-taking fosters positive social attitudes more effectively than ingroup VR perspective-taking. Findings are categorized according to social attitude object and discussed in the light of emerging challenges and opportunities for VR attitude research.},

However, even though increasing anthropomorphism is often seen as a promising way to achieve this goal, the uncanny valley effect proposes that anthropomorphism can be detrimental to acceptance unless robots are almost indistinguishable from humans. Against this background, we use a dual processing theory approach to investigate whether an uncanny valley of perceived trustworthiness (PT) can be observed for social robots and how this effect differs between the intuitive and deliberate reasoning system. The results of an experiment with four conditions and 227 participants provide support for the uncanny valley effect. Furthermore, mediation analyses suggested that use intention decreases through both reduced intuitive and deliberate PT for medium levels of anthropomorphism. However, for high levels of anthropomorphism (indistinguishable from real human), only intuitive PT determined use intention. Consequently, our results indicate both advantages and pitfalls of anthropomorphic design.},

Based on existing background research that largely emphasized puppetry as metaphor, we briefly touch on the use of puppetry in current games, before presenting our own design approach and implementation of existing puppet schemes in VR. Three initial controller mappings for virtual rod puppets, marionettes, and hand puppets serve to highlight opportunities and challenges in this approach. The overall goal is to re-establish a puppet-based perspective to character controls for VR and to highlight the emerging design space for games.},

The experiment varied the level of anthropomorphism of the image of interactants: high anthropomorphism, low anthropomorphism, or no image. Perceived agency was manipulated by telling the participants that the image was either an avatar controlled by a human, or an agent controlled by a computer. The results support the prediction that people respond socially to both human and computercontrolled entities, and that the existence of a virtual image increases telepresence. Participants interacting with the less-anthropomorphic image reported more copresence and social presence than those interacting with partners represented by either no image at all or by a highly anthropomorphic image of the other, indicating that the more anthropomorphic images set up higher expectations that lead to reduced presence when these expectations were not met.},

However, it appears that worldwide e-Government adoption has fallen short of predictions, but some countries are performing better than others. As a result, it is critical to improve residents' understanding of the reasons for and techniques of using government websites, as well as their attitudes about e-Government. This article addresses the issue by proposing a conceptual model for e-Government adoption that emphasizes the role of users in the implementation of e-Government. By adapting and tailoring the measurement scale from prior studies, the questionnaire approach was used to collect data. On 250 prospective respondents, a systematic convenience sampling approach was used. The finding of this study technical, personal, and dependability factors influence the intention to use e-Government, they have a significant impact on the actual adoption of e-Government services in Palestine. The government should develop a comprehensive e-government planning model based on demographic factors.},

Along with this paradigm shift, understanding of students' e-learning adoption behavior among various countries is urgently needed.Despite being one of the many countries that are still at the early stages in implementing e-learning, Palestine is a country that has recently seen an expansion in the number of students and the quality of education, which involved high investment on e-learning. Hence, studies on this area of research interest have yet to be made known within the field of education. This study attempted to address the disparity within the literature for an individual country, Palestine, on the significant influences towards adopting e-learning. A model that investigates the effects of quality features, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness on the intentions and satisfaction of the learners towards the effects of e-learning is proposed in this study. This model encompassed the constructs and variables embedded in TAM and ISSM along with instructor quality. The outcomes of the model, such as actual use and the moderating effect of technical support towards e-learning in Palestine, were investigated. The study proposed that the quality of the course, instructor, service and system as well as perceived usefulness determined the satisfaction among students to use e-learning.},

  abstract = {User engagement (UE) and its measurement have been of increasing interest in human-computer interaction (HCI). The User Engagement Scale (UES) is one tool developed to measure UE, and has been used in a variety of digital domains. The original UES consisted of 31-items and purported to measure six dimensions of engagement: aesthetic appeal, focused attention, novelty, perceived usability, felt involvement, and endurability. A recent synthesis of the literature questioned the original six-factors. Further, the ways in which the UES has been implemented in studies suggests there may be a need for a briefer version of the questionnaire and more effective documentation to guide its use and analysis. This research investigated and verified a four-factor structure of the UES and proposed a Short Form (SF). We employed contemporary statistical tools that were unavailable during the UES' development to re-analyze the original data, consisting of 427 and 779 valid responses across two studies, and examined new data (N=344) gathered as part of a three-year digital library project. In this paper we detail our analyses, present a revised long and short form (SF) version of the UES, and offer guidance for researchers interested in adopting the UES and UES-SF in their own studies.},

In this review, recent technological and statistical innovations with the potential to advance this body of research are presented. First, concerns over the validity of longitudinal models are discussed before innovative analytical techniques are introduced that explore change over time. Next, intensive repeated measure designs, such as experience sampling approaches, are introduced as opportunities to investigate the day-to-day lives of individuals. Virtual reality technology is then presented as another means to examine naturalistic contact experiences in the laboratory, offering researchers an unrivaled capacity to induce uncommon contact experiences. Finally, we propose that additional sources of contextual data, such as competing media messages, could extend these models in innovative ways by accounting for the time and place surrounding intergroup contact. Similarly, longitudinal social network analysis can provide additional contextual information by considering the broader network environment in which contact occurs. We describe these innovations with the intention of spurring future research that will advance our understanding of how intergroup contact can be used to improve our societies. Thus, we conclude with a discussion on how to bridge divides between researchers and practitioners.},

For both field tests we interviewed visitors regarding their impressions of the Telenoid. The results of the shopping mall showed that almost half of the interviewed visitors reported having negative feelings toward the Telenoid. But once they gave the Telenoid a hug, they changed their opinions from negative to positive. Meanwhile, the results of the other test showed that the majority of aged persons reported having a positive opinion. As a remarkable point, all aged persons who interacted with the Telenoid gave it a hug without any specific instruction from us. These results show that the Telenoid must be an acceptable medium for the elderly. However, the Telenoid might also be acceptable for younger persons because the visitors we interviewed developed positive feelings toward the robot after giving it a hug. These results inform our future research working with and developing androids.},

  abstract = {Textile based pneumatic actuators have recently seen increased development for use in wearable applications thanks to their high strength to weight ratio and range of achievable actuation modalities. However, the design of these textile-based actuators is typically an iterative process due to the complexity of predicting the soft and compliant behavior of the textiles. In this work we investigate the actuation mechanics of a range of physical prototypes of unfolding textile-based actuators to understand and develop an intuition for how the geometric parameters of the actuator affect the moment it generates, enabling more deterministic designs in the future. Under benchtop conditions the actuators were characterized at a range of actuator angles and pressures (0 --136 kPa), and three distinct performance regimes were observed, which we define as Shearing, Creasing, and Flattening. During Flattening, the effects of both the length and radius of the actuator dominate with maximum moments in excess of 80 Nm being generated, while during Creasing the radius dominates with generated moments scaling with the cube of the radius. Low stiffness spring like behavior is observed in the Shearing regime, which occurs as the actuator approaches its unfolded angle. A piecewise analytical model was also developed and compared to the experimental results within each regime. Finally, a prototype actuator was also integrated into a shoulder assisting wearable robot, and on-body characterization of this robot was performed on five healthy individuals to observe the behavior of the actuators in a wearable application. Results from this characterization highlight that these actuators can generate useful on-body moments (10.74 Nm at 90{$^\circ$} actuator angle) but that there are significant reductions compared to bench-top performance, in particular when mostly folded and at higher pressures.},

Furthermore, we propose an automatic unpleasant stimuli avoidance system using online machine learning architecture constructed from echo state networks (ESNs) and Accumulator Based Arbitration Models (ABAMs) that can also flexibly adapt to remote users. Because the handheld telepresence robot can avoid unpleasant stimuli before remote users experience these stimuli, it provides them with a more comfortable communication environment while notifying people around the robot that uncomfortable stimulation is being avoided.},

By comparing Western, Israeli, Palestinian, and regional media outlets, the study identifies key patterns in the use of emotionally charged narratives, political rhetoric, and imagery. It also highlights the implications of such representations, including the justification of military actions, dehumanisation of the adversary, and the manipulation of international perceptions. Furthermore, the analysis explains the long-term psychological, social, and political implications of these enemy images, emphasising the important need for responsible media reporting in fostering peace and understanding.},

  abstract = {National identity has become a catchword in discussions of the relations between culture and nation-states during recent decades. Narratives of nation have become crucial in the definition of the individual, so that other identities are usually understood only as slightly modifying it. The present paper starts from the fact that nation, national identity and nationalism are contextual and co ntested categories, and suggests a critical approach, labelled as the institutionalization of territories, which should evaluate the practices and ideological mechanisms involved in the production and reproduction of territories and their identities. The institutionalization of the Finnish territory and the representations of Finnish national identity are analysed as concrete examples. It is argued that national identities develop and change continually, so that each generation modifies it according to existing socio-cultural situations. Certain critical historical periods and specific natural and cultural elements seem to be crucial in the narration of Finnish identity.},

The outcomes of contact at work were analysed controlling for the influence of contact outside the workplace and through mass media, and taking into account the role of empathy, anxiety and group membership salience. Results indicate that the beneficial effects of contact at work were partially mediated by increased empathy and reduced anxiety, experienced both in the work environment and towards immigrants in general. Finally, high levels of group membership salience facilitated the influence of contact on intergroup emotions. These findings show that contact at work can be a powerful means to reduce prejudice, thanks to its capacity to evoke changes in affective responses. Copyright \# 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Despite the high stakes of this question, understanding of the mass media's role in shaping prejudiced beliefs, norms, and behavior is limited. A yearlong field experiment in Rwanda tested the impact of a radio soap opera featuring messages about reducing intergroup prejudice, violence, and trauma in 2 fictional Rwandan communities. Compared with a control group who listened to a health radio soap opera, listeners' perceptions of social norms and their behaviors changed with respect to intermarriage, open dissent, trust, empathy, cooperation, and trauma healing. However, the radio program did little to change listeners' personal beliefs. Group discussion and emotion were implicated in the process of media influence. Taken together, the results point to an integrated model of behavioral prejudice and conflict reduction that prioritizes the communication of social norms over changes in personal beliefs.

Despite their lightweight and simple structure, they have long inflation and deflation times, which make their quick use difficult. To resolve this issue, we propose an inflatable wrinkle actuator with fast inflation and deflation responses. First, a theoretical model is proposed to develop an actuator that satisfies the design requirements: the desired assistive torque and the foam factor based on the wearability. Second, we reduce the inflation and deflation times by partially controlling the actuator layers and by designing pneumatic circuits using a vacuum ejector. To validate the usability of the actuator in wearable suits, we applied it to a wearable knee suit, and the inflation and deflation times were 0.40 s and 0.16 s, respectively. As a result, we ensured that the actuator did not interfere with human knee joint movement during walking by creating any residual resistance.},

Previous methods directly feed the semantic layout as input to the deep network, which is then processed through stacks of convolution, normalization, and nonlinearity layers. We show that this is suboptimal as the normalization layers tend to ``wash away'' semantic information. To address the issue, we propose using the input layout for modulating the activations in normalization layers through a spatially-adaptive, learned transformation. Experiments on several challenging datasets demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method over existing approaches, regarding both visual fidelity and alignment with input layouts. Finally, our model allows user control over both semantic and style. Code is available at https://github.com/NVlabs/SPADE .},

  abstract = {Flow has been described as a state of optimal performance, experienced universally across a broad range of domains: from art to athletics, gaming to writing. However, its phenomenal characteristics can, at first glance, be puzzling. Firstly, individuals in flow supposedly report a loss of self-consciousness, even though they perform in a manner which evinces their agency and skill. Secondly, flow states are felt to be effortless, despite the prerequisite complexity of the tasks that engender them. In this paper, we unpick these features of flow, as well as others, through the active inference framework, which posits that action and perception are forms of active Bayesian inference directed at sustained self-organisation; i.e., the minimisation of variational free energy. We propose that the phenomenology of flow is rooted in the deployment of high precision over i) the expected sensory consequences of action and ii) beliefs about how action will sequentially unfold. This computational mechanism thus draws the agent to minimise the ensuing (i.e., expected) free energy through confident pragmatic action. Furthermore, given the challenging dynamics the flow-inducing situation presents, attention must be wholly focussed on the unfolding task whilst counterfactual planning is restricted, leading to the attested attenuation of sense of self as an epistemic being. This involves a reduced sense of self as a planning (or time-travelling) entity, as well as the elimination of propositional thought and higher--order, meta-cognitive conceptualisations of self. Our approach to action-centred phenomenology can be applied to similar facets of agentive experience beyond canonical flow states, providing insights into the mechanisms of selfless experiences, embodied expertise and wellbeing.},

It will give future researchers insights into the topics, methodologies and findings of such research from 1999--2019. Design/methodology/approach This study conducts a meta-analysis of 72 articles using the Wildcard operator search method and the Boolean operator to perform an integrative literature search related to gender discrimination studies done in relationship to or specific to the UAE. Findings In total, 88 papers related to the UAE and gender gap and women were identified. The articles were narrowed down to the ones published in high-ranked or Scopus journals (72). The findings suggest a decreasing trend in gender discrimination, but the issue still persists, requiring efforts from policy-makers, society and government to ensure gender parity is achieved. Academic research on women in STEM/SET workplace, specific to the UAE and the region, continue to slowly advance, with very few articles published in the same. Practical implications The study provides insights into gender gap research done in the past ten years specific to the UAE national women and gender gap in general and their career choices and prospects in the STEM/SET domain. Social implications There is a need to focus research on Emirati women in STEM careers to develop more insights into gender gap perceptions of Emirati women and identify challenges and methods to close the gender gap in STEM careers. Originality/value This paper brings a holistic perspective to the meta-analysis of research on the gender gap and women in the UAE's STEM domain.},

Evaluation of emotion expressions recognition becomes, thus, an important step in the development of project involving interaction between humans and avatars. In the present paper we describe the results of an evaluation experiment made in two settings: discrimination between three videos looking for a specific emotion expression and identification task that asks for the selection of a list of a seen expression. The obtained results are similar to previous studies from the field and underline again the necessity of careful design of some particular emotions, especially those one that can be considered from the same family.},

  abstract = {This thesis is a postphenomenological interrogation into the use of soft robots as mediating bodies between humans, attempting to unfetishize their imaginative figure of the stranger through an event I call incarnation. Based on my own encounters with Palestinians for conflict resolution and through readings of phenomenological and sociological studies, I determine the importance of the physical body, its fleshiness, nonlinearity and organic qualities for the constitution of intercorporeality - a meaningful and transformative dialog. I investigate the potential of non-human robotic avatars to achieve intercorpreality and liberate the interlocutors from prejudice and identity constraints, proposing the use of soft robots as a medium of re-embodiment that could facilitate massive scale physical incarnations and create physical encounters between people who are unable to otherwise meet in person. As a proof-of-concept, a novel method for the production of soft robotic avatars is introduced, capable of bodily haptics, language translation, and animalistic emotional expression. The avatar is operated using a web-based software platform that enables easy development of third party applications. Using this method, HITODAMA, a first prototype for a soft robotic avatar, is produced. I perform an initial evaluation of the robot in an encounter between people of different cultures, using an example app in which they get to know one another using pictures. I analyze the results by conducting interviews with the participants, following the principles of interpretative phenomenological analysis.},

However, the potential of technology to expand and enrich these methods, particularly in intergroup settings, is still underexplored. We introduce a novel combination of participatory design, technological education, and theater: a telerobotic theater of the oppressed. We invited activists from Israel and Palestine to learn telerobotic technology and create puppet shows to run simultaneously on both sides of the border. During a weekend workshop, we created and tested the performance in two rooms, simulating Israel and Palestine. We collected, coded, and analyzed qualitative data consisting of semi-structured interviews, videos, photos, and notes. The findings demonstrate how the solution promotes intergroup contact, directly through creative collaboration and indirectly through remote performances. The analysis serves as a guide for adapting Boal's facilitation method, the joker system, to digital technology.},

It warns that if Jewish-Arab relations in Israel continue to deteriorate, this will pose a serious threat to the stability of Israel, to the quality of Israeli democracy and to the potential for peace in the Middle East. The book examines the views and attitudes of both the Palestinian minority and the Jewish majority, as well as the Israeli state's historic approach to its Arab citizens.

However, avatar customization also increased user identifiability, which was linked to reduced social distance. Priming a common ingroup identity increased identity salience but did not influence social distance. In examining heterogeneous effects by prior levels of issue involvement, participants with high and moderate involvement with immigration showed increased social distance after customizing an avatar to resemble their real selves, thus implying boomerang effects.

  abstract = {Origami, the ancient art of paper folding, has inspired the design of engineering devices and structures for decades. The underlying principles of origami are very general, which has led to applications ranging from cardboard containers to deployable space structures. More recently, researchers have become interested in the use of active materials (i.e., those that convert various forms of energy into mechanical work) to effect the desired folding behavior. When used in a suitable geometry, active materials allow engineers to create self-folding structures. Such structures are capable of performing folding and/or unfolding operations without being kinematically manipulated by external forces or moments. This is advantageous for many applications including space systems, underwater robotics, small scale devices, and selfassembling systems. This article is a survey and analysis of prior work on active self-folding structures as well as methods and tools available for the design of folding structures in general and self-folding structures in particular. The goal is to provide researchers and practitioners with a systematic view of the state-of-the-art in this important and evolving area. Unifying structural principles for active self-folding structures are identified and used as a basis for a quantitative and qualitative comparison of numerous classes of active materials. Design considerations specific to folded structures are examined, including the issues of crease pattern identification and fold kinematics. Although few tools have been created with active materials in mind, many of them are useful in the overall design process for active self-folding structures. Finally, the article concludes with a discussion of open questions for the field of origami-inspired engineering.},

We meta-analyzed experimental and correlational evidence from 88 independent samples (n = 9,385). Digital intergroup contact showed a small but significant effect consistent with prejudice reduction (g = 0.25). Direct digital contact showed larger effect than indirect forms of contact, and contact via computer-mediated communication showed larger effects than contact achieved via other activities such as interacting with nonplayable characters or embodiment. The effects were similar regardless of the type of out-group targeted by prejudice. Overall, meta-analytical results suggest that digital intergroup contact may reduce prejudice.},

The open statements analysed here about the contact situations and the ensuing evaluation of the Others were collected as part of an online questionnaire (N=1959). After a short theoretical introduction we reveal the intertwined nature of construing language use: first in each specific borderland, then in the triads speaking together either in the native language of one of the groups (Czechs with Austrians and Germans) or with each speaking their own native languages (Czechs with Poles and Slovaks). Finally we highlight several effects we have observed as a result of being able to compare the situation in more than one neighbourhood, for instance, the effect of the different statuses of the languages involved, or the connection between the language used in contact and a feeling of proximity.},

A meta-analysis of more than 500 studies established the theory's basic contention that intergroup contact typically reduces prejudices of many types. This paper addresses the issue of process: just how does contact diminish prejudice? We test meta-analytically the three most studied mediators: contact reduces prejudice by (1) enhancing knowledge about the outgroup, (2) reducing anxiety about intergroup contact, and (3) increasing empathy and perspective taking. Our tests reveal mediational effects for all three of these mediators. However, the mediational value of increased knowledge appears less strong than anxiety reduction and empathy. Limitations of the study and implications of the results are discussed. Copyright \# 2008 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Multiple tests indicate that this finding appears not to result from either participant selection or publication biases, and the more rigorous studies yield larger mean effects. These contact effects typically generalize to the entire outgroup, and they emerge across a broad range of outgroup targets and contact settings. Similar patterns also emerge for samples with racial or ethnic targets and samples with other targets. This result suggests that contact theory, devised originally for racial and ethnic encounters, can be extended to other groups. A global indicator of Allport's optimal contact conditions demonstrates that contact under these conditions typically leads to even greater reduction in prejudice. Closer examination demonstrates that these conditions are best conceptualized as an interrelated bundle rather than as independent factors. Further, the meta-analytic findings indicate that these conditions are not essential for prejudice reduction. Hence, future work should focus on negative factors that prevent intergroup contact from diminishing prejudice as well as the development of a more comprehensive theory of intergroup contact.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in intergroup contact theory and research are reviewed. A meta-analysis with 515 studies and more than 250,000 subjects demonstrates that intergroup contact typically reduces prejudice (mean r = -.21). Allport's original conditions for optimal contact --equal status, common goals, no intergroup competition, and authority sanction -- facilitate the effect but are not necessary conditions. There are other positive outcomes of intergroup contact, such as greater trust and forgiveness for past transgressions. These contact effects occur not only for ethnic groups but also for such other groups as homosexuals, the disabled and the mentally ill. Intergroup friendship is especially important. Moreover, these effects typically generalize beyond the immediate outgroup members in the situation to the whole outgroup, other situations, and even to other outgroups not involved in the contact. They also appear to be universal -- across nations, genders, and age groups. The major mediators of the effect are basically affective: reduced anxiety and empathy. And even indirect contact reduces prejudice -- vicarious contact through the mass media and having a friend who has an outgroup friend. Of course, negative contact occurs -- especially when it is non-voluntary and threatening. Criticisms of the theory and policy implications are also discussed.},

  abstract = {The marriage of textiles with artificial muscles to create smart textiles is attracting great attention from the scientific community and industry. Smart textiles offer many benefits including adaptive comfort and high conformity to objects while providing active actuation for desired motion and force. This paper introduces a new class of programmable smart textiles created from different methods of knitting, weaving, and sticking fluid-driven artificial muscle fibers. Mathematical models are developed to describe the elongation-force relationship of the knitting and weaving textile sheets, followed by experiments to validate the model effectiveness. The new smart textiles are highly flexible, conformable, and mechanically programmable, enabling multimodal motions and shape-shifting abilities for use in broader applications. Different prototypes of the smart textiles are created with experimental validations including various shape-changing instances such as elongation (up to 65\%), area expansion (108\%), radial expansion (25\%), and bending motion. The concept of reconfiguring passive conventional fabrics into active structures for bio-inspired shape-morphing structures is also explored. The proposed smart textiles are expected to contribute to the progression of smart wearable devices, haptic systems, bio-inspired soft robotics, and wearable electronics.},

Here we seek to provide a unifying framework that incorporates the key aspects of entrainment as it has been studied in these varying domains. We propose that there are a number of types of entrainment that build upon pre-existing adaptations that allow organisms to perceive stimuli as rhythmic, to produce periodic stimuli, and to integrate the two using sensory feedback. We suggest that social entrainment is a special case of spatiotemporal coordination where the rhythmic signal originates from another individual. We use this framework to understand the function and evolutionary basis for coordinated rhythmic movement and to explore questions about the nature of entrainment in music and dance. The framework of entrainment presented here has a number of implications for the vocal learning hypothesis and other proposals for the evolution of coordinated rhythmic behavior across an array of species.},

The article outlines four themes and shows the relevance of HCI as a tool for political activism, consisting of the usage of HCI tools in political activism, the role of hashtag activism and the concerns with HCI for political activism. Additionally, this paper explores literature for HCI research that has a political approach, including the methods, theories and tools that brought the political to HCI fields, the concerns regarding political activist approaches, and the need for accountability. Future research in HCI is advised to investigate the role political activism in the past two years.

Further, we found that although access barriers have a significant effect in the model, perceptions regarding ease of use and usefulness have a stronger effect. Our results suggest that by extending the TAM, to include perceived access barriers helps to explain demographic-based differences in Internet use.

Studies in colonial and exploration discourse have identified the enormous significance of travel writing as an ideological apparatus of Empire.

Imperial Eyes explores European travel and exploration writing, in connection with European economic and political expansion since 1700. It is both a study in genre, and a critique of ideology. Pratt examines how travel books by Europeans create the domestic subject of European imperialism, and how they engage metropolitan reading publics with expansionist enterprises whose material benefits accrued mainly to the very few. These questions are addressed through readings of particular travel accounts connected with particular historical transitions, from the eighteenth century to Paul Theroux: sentimental travel writing and its links with abolitionist rhetoric, discursive reinventions of South America during the period of its independence (1800-1840), and eighteenth-century European writings on Southern Africa in the context of inland expansion."--Publisher's description},

Structural violence, despite its pervasiveness and positive correlation with violent conflict, is often overlooked within key debates in peacebuilding. Arts, despite its prevalence at ground level, continue to remain outside the mainstream approaches to peacebuilding. In this article, I bring these two domains together and explore the potential of sustained engagement through theatre in building peace within violent structural narratives at community level. Based on an empirical study in West Bengal, India, I argue that theatre has the potential to bring prevalent but less-heard narratives of structural violence into communal discourse. I identify two key elements in this process: first, theatre offers a space where onstage resistance to structural violence is performed. Second, the performed resistance leads to triggering transformation within the violent structural narratives.},

  abstract = {Introduction. Fair Play is an avatar-based role-playing video game in which Jamal Davis, a Black graduate student at a research university, navigates implicit forms of racial bias to reach the win-state of earning his PhD and becoming a professor. Fair Play was designed to educate players on the existence of racial bias in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine (STEMM) fields in an experiential way and to encourage perspective-taking. Research has found that taking the perspective of another can induce empathy, which improves the empathizer's attitudes towards individuals and groups. Paired with a facilitated workshop, Fair Play was also designed to teach bias concepts to increase participants' bias literacy., Intervention. Research on workshops to reduce gender bias suggests that it increased awareness of personal bias, the motivation and self-efficacy to practice bias-reducing strategies, and a more welcoming department climate and the hiring of more women faculty three years after the intervention. Capitalizing on these findings, a 3-hour workshop was developed to reduce race-based bias against Black/African Americans in STEMM using Fair Play., Conclusions. The facilitation of the workshops and Fair Play requires particular competencies due to its topic (racial bias) and player's skepticism about the reality of the bias incidents. Our data suggest that participants who identify as a person of color are more likely to believe that bias exists compared to White players, which can lead to a discussion about how the incidents in the game were designed and scripted. The facilitator also needs to be versed in a number of intentional design choices, such as Jamal not having voiceover and his success. Finally, this paper describes the Facilitator Game, which was developed as a complement to the game and allows a facilitator to jump to bias incidents quickly while debriefing and discussing the game to further participant learning.},

The issue editors introduce articles that theorize the use of puppets for a purpose and present dialogues with practitioners working in the field. The authors emphasize the power of puppetry within contemporary cultural systems and the plethora of diverse practices comprising applied puppetry. The lively and developing field of applied puppetry is presented as involving new thinking and methods that have been adopted globally. The editorial argues that applied puppetry, as well as being a set of practices that can affect the lives of participants, is also a robust academic field. The authors hope for a reconsideration of objects in applied theatre practice generally, as a way to further understand networks in socially engaged performance practices.},

  abstract = {Generalization by learning is an essential cognitive competency for humans. For example, we can manipulate even unfamiliar objects and can generate mental images before enacting a preplan. How is this possible? Our study investigated this problem by revisiting our previous study (Jung, Matsumoto, \&amp; Tani, 2019), which examined the problem of vision-based, goal-directed planning by robots performing a task of block stacking. By extending the previous study, our work introduces a large network comprising dynamically interacting submodules, including visual working memory (VWMs), a visual attention module, and an executive network. The executive network predicts motor signals, visual images, and various controls for attention, as well as masking of visual information. The most significant difference from the previous study is that our current model contains an additional VWM. The entire network is trained by using predictive coding and an optimal visuomotor plan to achieve a given goal state is inferred using active inference. Results indicate that our current model performs significantly better than that used in Jung et al. (2019), especially when manipulating blocks with unlearned colors and textures. Simulation results revealed that the observed generalization was achieved because content-agnostic information processing developed through synergistic interaction between the second VWM and other modules during the course of learning, in which memorizing image contents and transforming them are dissociated. This letter verifies this claim by conducting both qualitative and quantitative analysis of simulation results.},

Robotic telepresence systems - systems that combine video-conferencing capabilities with robotic navigation to allow geographically dispersed people to maneuver in remote locations - represent remote users, operators, to local users, locals, through the use of an alternate physical representation. In this representation, physical characteristics such as height are dictated by the manufacturer of the system. We conducted a two-by-two (relative system height: shorter vs. taller; team role: leader vs. follower), between-participants study (n = 40) to investigate how the system's height affects the local's perceptions of the operator and subsequent interactions. Our findings show that, when the system was shorter than the local and the operator was in a leadership role, the local found the operator to be less persuasive. Furthermore, having a leadership role significantly affected the local's feelings of dominance with regard to being in control of the conversation.},

To realize it, this paper contributes by doing an empirical test of the technology acceptance model, amongst those users typically always deprived in the existing social structure. Firstly, the study aims to examine the influence of Technology Readiness Index (TRI) 2.0{$\prime$}s four indicators (optimism, innovativeness, discomfort and insecurity) on bKash entrepreneurs' perceived ease of use (PEOU) and perceived usefulness (PU) of bKash technology. Secondly, it aims to investigate the effect of `bKash' entrepreneurs' PEOU and PU on their well-being. A total of 360 usable data were collected from the bKash agents in Bangladesh. We employed SEM-PLS3.0 for data analysis. The results indicate that optimism and innovativeness strongly drive perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. Subjective well-being was found to be strongly predicted by perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. The study indicates that poor people are somewhat ready to use and accept technology that leads to a sense of well-being. Bringing together the concept of subjective well-being with TRI and Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) is this paper's contribution to the knowledge domain.},

In this paper we show how to combine prior knowledge and evidence from the expert's actions to derive a probability distribution over the space of reward functions. We present efficient algorithms that find solutions for the reward learning and apprenticeship learning tasks that generalize well over these distributions. Experimental results show strong improvement for our methods over previous heuristic-based approaches.},

  abstract = {Are students willing to accept robotic support for learning when their attitudes toward educational robots are moderate? Probably not, as evidence from psychological research has suggested that attitudes predict how people will behave toward an attitude object. Consequently, a negative view of robots could represent a strong barrier to the deployment of robots in educational environments. Attitude change might facilitate a smooth introduction of educational robots into learning settings. Thus, the present research builds on the fact that actively including end users in the prototyping process of a robot might increase positive attitudes toward it. Indeed, our research is among the first works which demonstratethat participation in the prototyping process of an educational robot positively affected attitudes toward educational robots in general and significantly reduced educational robot anxiety. However, students' behavioral intentions toward educational robots were not influenced by participation. These findings raise intriguing questions regarding the relevance of user involvement in the development of robots. Therefore, the discussion focuses on how to improve this process and how user involvement in robot design processes provides a valuable contribution to the acceptance of social robots in everyday life.},

These are based on the assumption that such factors as immersion in a group and anonymity lead to a loss of selfhood and hence of control over behaviour. We argue that such models depend upon an individualistic conception of the self, viewed as a unitary construct referring to that which makes individuals unique. This is rejected in favour of the idea that self can be defined at various different levels including the categorical self as well as the personal self. Hence a social identity model of deindividuation (SIDE) is outlined. Evidence is presented to show that deindividuation manipulations gain effect, firstly, through the ways in which they affect the salience of social identity (and hence conformity to categorical norms) and, secondly, through their effects upon strategic considerations relating to the expression of social identities. We conclude that the classic deindividuation paradigm of anonymity within a social group, far from leading to uncontrolled behaviour, maximizes the opportunity of group members to give full voice to their collective identities.},

The visual context of a conversation has two aspects: the information that is available to each conversant, and their beliefs about what is present for each other. In our experiment, we separated these factors for the first time and examined their impact on a spontaneous conversation. We manipulated the fact that a visual scene was shared or not and the belief that a visual scene was shared or not. Participants watched videos of actors talking about a controversial topic, then discussed their own views while looking at either a blank screen or the actors. Each believed (correctly or not) that their partner was either looking at a blank screen or the same images. We recorded conversants' eye movements, quantified how they were coordinated, and analyzed their speech patterns. Gaze coordination has been shown to be causally related to the knowledge people share before a conversation, and the information they later recall. Here, we found that both the presence of the visual scene, and beliefs about its presence for another, influenced language use and gaze coordination.},

However, many promising applications are limited by the dependence of soft systems on electrical or pneumatic tethers. Recent work in soft actuation and electronics has made removing such cords more feasible, heralding a variety of applications from autonomous field robotics to wireless biomedical devices. Here we review the development of functional untethered soft robotics. We focus on recent advances in soft robotic actuation, sensing and integration as they relate to untethered systems, and consider the key challenges the field faces in engineering systems that could have practical use in real-world conditions.},

In particular, we wanted to understand how Arabic people might view having humanoid robots in their daily lives, and developed a questionnaire to understand these views. We also built an end-to-end Arabic conversational system on our humanoid robot Ibn Sina, and brought the robot to a mall in the United Arab Emirates. At the mall we encouraged people to interact with the robot as well as complete our questionnaire. With 131 respondents from 21 countries, our findings show significant regional differences in overall attitudes (people from the Gulf viewed humanoid robots more favorably than people from Africa), as well as an effect from college education (people with college degrees viewed humanoid robots less favorably than people without college degrees).},

Nurturing this communication via interfaith learning may reduce this conflict by fostering interfaith empathy. HCI has a dearth of knowledge on interfaith coexistence and empathy building. To address this gap, we present the design, implementation, and usability of Cohabitant: a virtual reality (VR) application that promotes interfaith learning and empathy. Cohabitant's design is theoretically underpinned by Allport's intergroup contact theory and informed by insights from a participatory workshop we ran with members of three religious groups: Christians, Hindus, and Muslims. Our evaluation study, combining quantitative and qualitative data from 30 participants, suggests that Cohabitant may enhance general interpersonal empathy, but falls short for ethnocultural empathy. We discuss the possible design and policy implications of using this kind of VR technology for interfaith learning and empathy building.},

In exploring these three issues we utilise theoretical interpretations of subjectivity and embodiment alongside a brief examination of a speech by Prime Minister Howard in order to elaborate our claim that racism is foundational to white subjectivities in Australia. By examining colonial violence and our relation to it, we seek to develop a framework within which psychological research on racism in Australia may disturb white claims to belonging by continuing to explore how racism works in the service of the `good nation'.

  abstract = {The significance of climate change for Middle Eastern regional security is the subject of a growing academic literature. Much of recent discussion has been concerned with the potential for climate change to act as a 'threat multiplier' that can trigger violent inter-state conflict, societal disorder, or the growth of militant and terrorist forces. However, it is only recently that  scholarship  has  considered  the  role  that  the  understanding  of  the  meaning  of  security  adopted  by  state  institutions  plays  in  shaping  the  precise  impacts  of  climate  change  on  Middle  Eastern  regional  politics.  In  order  to  address  this  less  widely  discussed  topic,  I  utilize  a  social  constructivist variant of the Copenhagen School's 'securitization theory' in  an  analysis  of  the  public  statements  and  policy  documents  of  actors  from  the  Israeli  and  Palestinian  Authority  (PA)  governments.  I  argue  that, for the most part, neither state has 'securitized' climate change, i.e. framed the issue as possessing extraordinary threat and urgency. Israel interprets climate change primarily through what I dub a 'technocratic' discourse, with a national security and environmental security discourse being  afforded  lower  priority.  The  PA,  meanwhile,  places  overwhelming  urgency  on  the  threat  of  Israeli  occupation,  such  that  few  other  issues  are afforded security status. Following Wilkinson (2010), I also examine the context of each state's climate change discourses, showing how their respective political structures and broader discourses of the environment and security are key to understanding the significance of climate change to  Israeli  and  Palestinian  state  institutions.  These  findings  offer  an  important  counterpoint  to  the  threat  multiplier  thesis,  showing  how  pre-existing  conflictual  relations  among  states  can  in  fact  reduce  the  likelihood that state actors will treat climate change as a security threat.}

Using the words of students who employ telepresent robots to attend class for them, I speculate on the role of the robot as a pliable representation of a person, and how it offers the human the opportunity to retain an embodied presence in a place (classroom) in a way that is impossible via the use of a screen. Embodiment and interaction -- known as intercorporeality is unique to the notion of `place'; without it, we cannot lay claim to being in any place. This assertion has implications for the argument that there can be such a thing as an online `place'. It is my intention that my paper will provide an inspirational base for future researchers to consider our relation to place as our notions of being somewhere come to be questioned.},

  abstract = {Postphenomenological Investigations: Essays on Human--Technology Relations provides an introduction to the school of thought called postphenomenology and showcases projects at the cutting edge of this perspective. Postphenomenology presents a unique blend of insights from the philosophical traditions of phenomenology and American pragmatism, and applies them to studies of user relations to technologies. These studies provide deep descriptions of the ways technologies transform our abilities, augment our experience, and shape the world around us. This book proceeds with a preface by Don Ihde, postphenomenology's founder, and a detailed review of the main ideas of this perspective by the editors Robert Rosenberger and Peter-Paul Verbeek. The body of this volume is composed of twelve postphenomenological essays which reflect the expansive range, detail-orientation, and interdisciplinarity of this school of thought. These essays confront a broad assortment of topics, both abstract and concrete. Abstract topics addressed include metaphysics, ethics, methodology, and analysis of the notions of selfhood, skill training, speed, and political activism. Just a few of the concrete topics studied include human-like interactive robots, ethics education, image interpretation in radiology, science fiction tropes, transportation history, wearable computing, and organ donation protocols for brain-dead bodies.

  abstract = {Agential realism---the idea that it makes sense to view the world as being composed of various forms of protean nonhuman agency---has been a topic of discussion for many social science scholars in recent years. This increase of interest in agent ontologies can be attributed to the new feminist materialist movement in the philosophy of science literature. However, agent ontologies also are found in Indigenous studies literature and in Peircean pragmatism. These latter sources are also a part of the current methodological conversation about nonhuman agency. This article explores the connections between agential realist philosophy and social science research that employs narrative forms of analysis and representation. The goal is to assist narrative researchers in avoiding oversimplification by tracing out different strands in these literatures and mapping out points of connection and disconnection in detail. Intersections that hold the promise of complementary development are highlighted.},

These animals have mastered the ability to repair and replace most of their tissues following damage or amputation even well into adulthood. In fact it seems that the ability of these organisms to regenerate perfectly is not affected by their age. In addition to being able to regenerate, these animals display a remarkable resistance to cancer. They therefore represent a unique model organism to study regeneration and cancer resistance in vertebrates. The need for this research is even more pressing at the dawn of the 21st century as we are faced with an ever aging world population which has to deal with an increase in organ failure and cancer incidence. Hopefully, this mini review will put in perspective some of the reasons why studying tissue regeneration in salamanders could yield significant knowledge to help regenerative medicine achieve the desired goal of allowing humans to repair and regenerate some of their own tissues as they age.},

The need to further problematise and critically examine participation is nonetheless apparent. This special issue aims to shed light on participation as it unfolds over time during, between and beyond participatory events such as these. Here, we build an overview of existing directions taken by researchers to address the unfolding of participation in IT design over time. We do this by examining existing PD literature and the four contributions to this special issue. We identify two common temporalities in PD, the future-oriented and the project-based, and propose five lenses that may aid researchers in exploring and understanding the temporal dimensions of participation in their projects: the phasic, emergent, retrospective, prospective and long-term lenses. We end with propositions and opportunities for future research directions in PD, highlighting the multi-faceted nature of the temporality of participation.},

  abstract = {The Free Energy Principle and Active Inference Framework (FEP-AI) begins with the understanding that persisting systems must regulate environmental exchanges and prevent entropic accumulation. In FEP-AI, minds and brains are predictive controllers for autonomous systems, where action-driven perception is realized as probabilistic inference. Integrated Information Theory (IIT) begins with considering the preconditions for a system to intrinsically exist, as well as axioms regarding the nature of consciousness. IIT has produced controversy because of its surprising entailments: quasi-panpsychism; subjectivity without referents or dynamics; and the possibility of fully-intelligent-yet-unconscious brain simulations. Here, I describe how these controversies might be resolved by integrating IIT with FEP-AI, where integrated information only entails consciousness for systems with perspectival reference frames capable of generating models with spatial, temporal, and causal coherence for self and world. Without that connection with external reality, systems could have arbitrarily high amounts of integrated information, but nonetheless would not entail subjective experience. I further describe how an integration of these frameworks may contribute to their evolution as unified systems theories and models of emergent causation. Then, inspired by both Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT) and the Harmonic Brain Modes framework, I describe how streams of consciousness may emerge as an evolving generation of sensorimotor predictions, with the precise composition of experiences depending on the integration abilities of synchronous complexes as self-organizing harmonic modes (SOHMs). These integrating dynamics may be particularly likely to occur via richly connected subnetworks affording body-centric sources of phenomenal binding and executive control. Along these connectivity backbones, SOHMs are proposed to implement turbo coding via loopy message-passing over predictive (autoencoding) networks, thus generating maximum a posteriori estimates as coherent vectors governing neural evolution, with alpha frequencies generating basic awareness, and cross-frequency phase-coupling within theta frequencies for access consciousness and volitional control. These dynamic cores of integrated information also function as global workspaces, centered on posterior cortices, but capable of being entrained with frontal cortices and interoceptive hierarchies, thus affording agentic causation. Integrated World Modeling Theory (IWMT) represents a synthetic approach to understanding minds that reveals compatibility between leading theories of consciousness, thus enabling inferential synergy.},

As predicted, across both studies, the desire to talk about power was greater among members of disadvantaged than of advantaged groups. This difference was mediated by motivation for change in group-based power. Study 2 further demonstrated that more highly identified members of disadvantaged groups wanted to talk about power more. Members of advantaged groups generally preferred to talk about commonalities between the groups more than about group-based power, and this desire was greater with higher levels of identification. However, perceiving that their group's advantage was illegitimate increased the desire of advantaged group members to address power in intergroup interactions.},

We propose that beyond improving attitudes toward the out-group, positive contact affects disadvantaged-group members' perceptions of intergroup inequality in ways that can undermine their support for social change toward equality. In Study 1, participants were assigned to either high- or lowpower experimental groups and then brought together to discuss either commonalities between the groups or intergroup differences. Commonality-focused contact, relative to difference-focused contact, produced heightened expectations for fair (i.e., egalitarian) out-group behavior among members of disadvantaged groups. These expectations, however, proved unrealistic when compared against the actions of members of the advantaged groups. Participants in Study 2 were Israeli Arabs (a disadvantaged minority) who reported the amount of positive contact they experienced with Jews. More positive intergroup contact was associated with increased perceptions of Jews as fair, which in turn predicted decreased support for social change. Implications for social change are considered.},

  abstract = {An extensive meta-analysis of the contact literature, summarizing over five hundred studies across a wide range of contexts and countries, found that although intergroup contact was related to improved attitudes among members of both advantaged and disadvantaged groups, it was found to be significantly less effective for improving the outgroup attitudes of disadvantaged group members than those of advantaged group members. Furthermore, optimal conditions in the contact situation (e.g., cooperation, equal status, institutional support) were found to facilitate the effect of contact only for members of advantaged groups; the presence of these conditions did not have a significant impact on disadvantaged group members involved in intergroup contact. Researchers have begun to consider differences in how advantaged versus disadvantaged group members approach, experience, and are affected by intergroup contact. For instance, findings from a U.S. national survey show that while positive effects of contact are typically observed among White Americans, they are significantly inhibited among Black Americans who perceive high levels of discrimination against their racial group. Experimental and diary studies further indicate that exposure to prejudice and discrimination can undermine minorities' willingness to engage in contact with members of the advantaged majority group. Still, such findings offer little information regarding the ways in which group differences in power are enacted in contact settings, or how intergroup contact can either perpetuate or ameliorate group differences in power. In this chapter, we review emerging evidence that can advance our understanding of the intersection of power and contact between groups. We begin by considering how psychological processes associated with group position (i.e., advantaged versus disadvantaged group membership) relate to how people approach contact situations in terms of their goals and preferences for the content of intergroup encounters. We then describe research that links the consequences of intergroup contact to power asymmetries between groups and to processes that promote social change. We conclude by discussing the implications of this work for research and practice on improving intergroup relations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Female participants (N = 133) customized an avatar in a digital game to reflect either the ideal, ought, or actual self. Participants then selected food items for their avatar within the digital game as well as food items for themselves to eat afterward. Results suggest that for participants using an ought-self avatar, the extent to which they were conscious of their health was positively related to healthier food choice both within and after playing the game. No such effect emerged for participants who used an ideal- or actual-self avatar, indicating that participants formed the goal of being healthy only with regard to the ought self. This study demonstrates that avatar customization in a digital game can serve a regulatory function by representing individuals' duties and responsibilities, thus, causing them to adopt such attributes manifested in their avatar during and after the game.},

In conventional methods to manipulate a puppet (a hand-puppet, a string-puppet, and a rod-puppet), there is a need to practice manipulating puppets, and there is difficulty carrying out interactions with the audience. Moreover, puppeteers must be positioned exactly where the puppet is. The proposed system addresses these issues by enabling a human performer to manipulate the puppet remotely using his or her body and facial movements. We conducted several user studies with both beginners and professional puppeteers. The results show that, unlike the conventional method, the proposed system facilitates the manipulation of puppets especially for beginners. Moreover, this system allows performers to enjoy puppetry and fascinate audiences.},

  abstract = {Open-domain dialog generation is a challenging problem; maximum likelihood training can lead to repetitive outputs, models have difficulty tracking long-term conversational goals, and training on standard movie or online datasets may lead to the generation of inappropriate, biased, or offensive text. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a powerful framework that could potentially address these issues, for example by allowing a dialog model to optimize for reducing toxicity and repetitiveness. However, previous approaches which apply RL to open-domain dialog generation do so at the word level, making it difficult for the model to learn proper credit assignment for long-term conversational rewards. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL), VHRL, which uses policy gradients to tune the utterance-level embedding of a variational sequence model. This hierarchical approach provides greater flexibility for learning long-term, conversational rewards. We use self-play and RL to optimize for a set of human-centered conversation metrics, and show that our approach provides significant improvements -- in terms of both human evaluation and automatic metrics -- over state-of-the-art dialog models, including Transformers.},

  abstract = {How do politeness strategies and cultural aspects affect robot acceptance and anthropomorphization across native speakers of English and Arabic? Previous work in cross-cultural HRI studies has mostly focused on Western and East Asian cultures. In contrast, Middle Eastern attitudes and perceptions of robot assistants are a barely researched topic. We investigated culture-specific determinants of robot acceptance and anthropomorphization by conducting a between-subjects study in Qatar. A total of 92 native speakers of either English or Arabic interacted with a receptionist robot in two different interaction tasks. We further manipulated the robot's verbal behavior in experimental sub-groups to explore different politeness strategies. Our results suggest that Arab participants perceived the robot more positively and anthropomorphized it more than English speaking participants. In addition, the use of positive politeness strategies and the change of interaction task had an effect on participants' HRI experience. Our findings complement the existing body of cross-cultural HRI research with a Middle Eastern perspective that will help to inform the design of robots intended for use in cross-cultural, multi-lingual settings.},

We present Robot-Mediated Applied Drama as a medium for safely exploring sensitive topics with children and propose to develop RE-Mind2: a pedagogical platform that aims to use role-playing with robots for fostering anti-bullying peer support among children. We borrow techniques from applied drama to build the human-robot interaction models used in this system. Specifically, we draw from Augusto Boal's Forum Theatre: a theatrical exercise in which spectators of a drama are invited to become ``spect-actors''. That is, they watch the performance twice; the second time, they stop the performance and change its direction and potential conclusion by suggesting different actions to the protagonist. This allows children to use the proposed system to first observe a bullying scenario between two robots, and then intervene by controlling a third robot that is a bystander to bullying, and by doing so practice their intervention strategies. Applied drama engages peers in situated learning and allows them to take reflective, participatory action. In this paper, we argue that using robots provides a buffer for participants to safely explore sensitive topics in a private setting. We present background literature to support using applied drama as an effective vehicle for learning and discuss related work on technology-based anti-bullying interventions. Finally, we define Robot-Mediated Applied Drama and discuss how social robots lend themselves well to this practice.},

This research investigates the concept of fun in educational games involving social robots to support the design of REMind : 3 a robot-mediated role-play game aimed at encouraging bystander intervention against peer bullying among children. To incorporate fun elements into design of REMind, we conducted a user-centered Research through Design (RtD) study with focus groups of children to gain a deeper understanding of their perceptions of fun. We analyzed children's ideas by using Framework Analysis and leveraging LeBlanc's Taxonomy of Game Pleasures and identified 28 elements of fun that can be incorporated into robot-mediated games. We present our observations, discuss their impact on REMind 's design, and offer recommendations for designing fun educational games using social robots.},

  abstract = {Two types of social influence can be distinguished: norm-based influence occurs when social identity is salient and interpersonal influence occurs when personal identity is salient. In two experiments the impact of trait and state private self-awareness on interpersonal influence during face-to-face and computer-mediated communication (CMC) was investigated. It is argued that interpersonal influence resulting from face-to-face communication is stronger than interpersonal influence resulting from CMC because CMC heightens state private self-awareness. As a result, it leads to a focus on personal perceptions and thoughts which in turn reduces attitude change. Experiment 1 suggests that communication media may influence attitude change via private self-awareness. Experiment 2 showed that trait private self-awareness moderates the effect of communication media on interpersonal influence. Interpersonal influence was stronger in face-to-face communication than in CMC only for individuals higher in private self-awareness. This finding indicates that the impact of situational variations of a concept can be limited to individuals who have a more elevated sense of private selfawareness.

Many innovative solutions have been developed in recent years to design soft components and systems. They all demonstrate how soft robotics development is closely dependent on advanced manufacturing processes. This review aims at giving an insight on the current state of the art in soft robotics manufacturing. It first puts in light the elementary components that can be used to develop soft actuators, whether they use fluids, shape memory alloys, electro-active polymers or stimuli-responsive materials. Other types of elementary components, such as soft smart structures or soft-rigid hybrid systems, are then presented. The second part of this review deals with the manufacturing methods used to build complete soft structures. It includes molding, with possibly reinforcements and inclusions, additive manufacturing, thin-film manufacturing, shape deposition manufacturing, and bonding. The paper conclusions sums up the pros and cons of the presented techniques, and open to developing topics such as design methods for soft robotics and sensing technologies.},

Guided by the biobehavioral synchrony conceptual frame, we tested bidirectional influences between the partners' hormones and conflict behavior at the initiation of romantic love. Participants included 120 new lovers (60 couples) and 40 singles. Plasma levels of five affiliation and stress-related hormones were assessed: oxytocin (OT), prolactin (PRL), testosterone (T), cortisol (CT), and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS). Couples were observed in conflict interaction coded for empathy and hostility. CT and DHEAS showed direct actor effects: higher CT and DHEAS predicted greater hostility. OT showed direct partner effects: individuals whose partners had higher OT showed greater empathy. T and CT showed combined actor-partner effects. High T predicted greater hostility only when partner also had high T, but lower hostility when partner had low T. Similarly, CT predicted low empathy only in the context of high partner's CT. Mediational analysis indicated that combined high CT in both partners was associated with relationship breakup as mediated by decrease in empathy. Findings demonstrate the mutual influences between hormones and behavior within an attachment bond and underscore the dynamic, co-regulated, and systemic nature of pair-bond formation in humans.},

  abstract = {Romantic relationships can have a profound effect on adults' health and well-being whereas the inability to maintain intimate bonds has been associated with physical and emotional distress. Studies in monogamous mammalian species underscore the central role of oxytocin (OT) in pair-bonding and human imaging studies implicate OT-rich brain areas in early romantic love. To assess the role of OT in romantic attachment, we examined plasma OT in 163 young adults: 120 new lovers (60 couples) three months after the initiation of their romantic relationship and 43 non-attached singles. Twenty-five of the 36 couples who stayed together were seen again six months later. Couples were observed in dyadic interactions and were each interviewed regarding relationship-related thoughts and behaviors. OT was significantly higher in new lovers compared to singles, F(1,152)=109.33, p{$<$}.001, which may suggest increased activity of the oxytocinergic system during the early stages of romantic attachment. These high levels of OT among new lovers did not decrease six months later and showed high individual stability. OT correlated with the couples' interactive reciprocity, including social focus, positive affect, affectionate touch, and synchronized dyadic states, and with anxieties and worries regarding the partner and the relationship, findings which parallel those described for parent-infant bonding. OT levels at the first assessment differentiated couples who stayed together six months later from those who separated during this period. Regression analysis showed that OT predicted interactive reciprocity independent of sex, relationship duration, and the partner's OT. Findings suggest that OT may play an important role at the first stages of romantic attachment and lend support to evolutionary models suggesting that parental and romantic attachment share underlying bio-behavioral mechanisms.},

Ongoing efforts in the design of telepresence robots promise remote access to physical settings and a greater sense of presence, leading to improved remote collaboration. However, a comparable sense of physical presence and utility has yet to be achieved. Mobile telepresence still provides limited ways to interact with remote users (e.g., with the environment and other people). This workshop aims to re-imagine telepresence robots, moving away from the decades-old `iPad-on-a-stick' paradigm. Using interactive activities involving existing telepresence robots and a hybrid workshop format, we hope to ideate ways of expanding the capabilities of mobile telepresence robots through a range of mechanisms (e.g., mobile and wearable technology, Augmented Reality, Internet of Things, etc.) and to inform the future design of these devices to provide additional affordances. In doing so, we plan to identify use cases for which mobile telepresence robots can provide additional value through their locomotive capabilities compared to current screen-based remote interactions. Lastly, we aim to identify scenarios for future research in Mobile HCI using use cases and affordances identified during the workshop to support more equitable participation for remote users.},

  abstract = {Within an embodied cognition framework, it is argued that presence in a virtual environment (VE) develops from the construction of a spatial-functional mental model of the VE. Two cognitive processes lead to this model: the representation of bodily actions as possible actions in the VE, and the suppression of incompatible sensory input. It is hypothesized that the conscious sense of presence reflects these two components as spatial presence and involvement. This prediction was confirmed in two studies (N ϭ 246 and N ϭ 296) assessing self-reports of presence and immersion experiences. Additionally, judgments of ``realness'' were observed as a third presence component. A second-order factor analysis showed a distinction between presence, immersion, and interaction factors. Building on these results, a thirteen-item presence scale consisting of three independent components was developed and verified using confirmatory factor analyses across the two studies.},

Even though disembodiment has been severely criticized in the literature, most conceptualizations of the role of users' bodies in virtuality nevertheless reflect a representational logic, which fails to capture contemporary users' experience of cyborgism. Relying on data collected from nine entrepreneurs in the virtual world Second Life (SL), this paper asks how embodied identity is performed in virtual worlds. Contrasting representationalism with performativity, this study highlights that the SL entrepreneurs intentionally re-presented in their avatars some of the attributes of physical bodies, but that they also engaged in habitual practices in-world, thereby unconsciously enacting embodied identities in both their `real' and virtual lives.},

Evaluations of real-world interventions, however, did not consistently confirm the positive impact of online intergroup contact. We advance the literature and investigate whether participation in a global online intergroup contact program predicts lower prejudice as well as increased outgroup knowledge, confidence, and tendencies to take collective action on behalf of outgroup members. We also assess if the quantity of online intergroup contact moderates developments of the outcome measures over time. Applying a pre-post design, participants (N = 547) completed surveys before and after the intervention. One follow-up survey was, depending on the program cohort, administered with a delay of six, 12, and 18 months. Throughout the intervention, prejudice decreased, and collective action tendencies, outgroup knowledge, as well as confidence in one's ability to communicate in intercultural environments increased. These trends were maintained for up to 18 months after program completion. Changes in attitude, knowledge, confidence, or collective action tendencies did not differ systematically between a four-weeks and an eight-weeks module. We conclude that online intergroup contact is a powerful tool to promote harmonious intergroup relations at scale.},

  abstract = {Computer-mediated intergroup contact (CMIC) is a valuable strategy to reduce negative sentiments towards members of different social groups. We examined whether characteristics of communication media that facilitate intergroup encounters shape its effect on out-group attitudes. Specifically, we propose that concealing individuating cues about out-group members during CMIC increases prejudice, as interaction partners are perceived as less socially present. To assess these hypotheses, we conducted two mixed-factorial experiments. Participants engaged in synchronous text-chat with out-group members (Study 1) and a confederate (Study 2) who either shared or concealed their name and photo. Overall, CMIC reduced negative out-group sentiments. Study 2 showed, however, that out-group members' anonymity decreased perceived social presence, which was associated with less positive evaluations of the CMIC and higher prejudice. In conclusion, CMIC can contribute to conflict resolution interventions, preparing individuals for direct intergroup contact, if its affordances or conversation topics enhance interaction partners' social presence.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews recent developments under the free energy principle that introduce a normative perspective on classical economic (utilitarian) decision-making based on (active) Bayesian inference. It has been suggested that the free energy principle precludes novelty and complexity, because it assumes that biological systems---like ourselves---try to minimize the long-term average of surprise to maintain their homeostasis. However, recent formulations show that minimizing surprise leads naturally to concepts such as exploration and novelty bonuses. In this approach, agents infer a policy that minimizes surprise by minimizing the difference (or relative entropy) between likely and desired outcomes, which involves both pursuing the goal-state that has the highest expected utility (often termed ``exploitation'') and visiting a number of different goal-states (``exploration''). Crucially, the opportunity to visit new states increases the value of the current state. Casting decision-making problems within a variational framework, therefore, predicts that our behavior is governed by both the entropy and expected utility of future states. This dissolves any dialectic between minimizing surprise and exploration or novelty seeking.},

We explore some of the key ideas of entanglement through a comparison of two phenomena in the travel sector: an institutionalized accreditation scheme offered by the AA and an online social media website hosted by TripAdvisor. Our analysis centers on the production of anonymity in these two practices of hotel evaluation. By examining how anonymity is constituted through an entanglement of matter and meaning, we challenge the predominantly social treatments of anonymity to date and draw attention to the uncertainties and outcomes generated by specific performances of anonymity in practice. In closing, we consider what the particular agential realist concept of entanglement entails for understanding anonymity, and discuss its implications for research practice.},

We argue that the emergent properties of self-categorization and social identity, which are particularly fluid and complex in online spaces, provide a complementary perspective with which to re-examine traditional topics in social computing. We discuss the applicability of the Social Identity Perspective to established and new research domains in CSCW, proposing alternative perspectives on self-presentation, social support, collaboration, conflict, and leadership. We note methodological considerations emerging from this theory. Finally, we consider how broad concepts and lessons from the Social Identity Perspective might inspire CSCW work in the future.},

  abstract = {One of the greatest potentials of immersive VR experiences, envisioned by broad sectors of the scientific community as well as the industry, is its use to increase empathy towards different types of populations and situations (Louie et al., 2018;van Loon et al., 2018;Modena and Pinotti, 2020). Some common ways in which VR has been used to enhance empathy are: 1) through the simulation of intergroup encounters, 2) by providing a bystander perspective of discriminative behaviors, or 3) by enabling participants to experience discriminative behaviors from the (embodied) perspective of an outgroup member or victim. There is evidence that some of these VR experiences might lead to positive outcomes, such as reducing implicit racial bias (Peck et al., 2013;Banakou et al., 2016Banakou et al., , 2020Hasler et al., 2017;Bedder et al., 2019), enhancing emotion recognition in relation to victims of violent behaviors (Hamilton-Giachritsis et al., 2018;Seinfeld et al., 2018Seinfeld et al., , 2022Ventura et al., 2021), or increasing empathy towards people with disabilities (Dyer et al., 2018;Brydon et al., 2021;Chowdhury and Quarles, 2021). Nonetheless, there are also studies reporting mixed findings, with VR not always leading to enhancements in empathy (Hasler et al., 2021), and even resulting in negative effects in certain cases (Groom et al., 2009;Sundar et al., 2017;Weinel et al., 2018;Banakou et al., 2020;Ventura et al., 2020;Martingano et al., 2021;Ho and Ng, 2022). For example, (Banakou et al. (2020) reported that negative affective VR simulations might result in an increase of implicit racial bias, supporting earlier findings by Groom et al. (2009), and a recent meta-analysis indicates that VR increases emotional components of empathy, rather than the cognitive ones (Martingano et al., 2021). Based on a review of studies, Bloom (2017) concludes that empathy does not lead to behavioral changes and argues instead for rational compassion.Such divergent results could be partially explained by the different types of methodologies employed, design factors, technologies used, and the virtual content itself implemented to address empathy, and variations in factors such as instructions (i.e., empathetic or in-his-shoes perspectiveshifting), realism (i.e, computer-graphics versus 360-degree videos), immersiveness (i.e., higher or lower), degree of interactivity (i.e., being able to modify the content or not), and visual perspective (i.e., 1PP with or without a virtual body, or bystander perspective). Recently, authors with diverse theoretical backgrounds have also started introducing and discussing the ethical implications of using VR as an empathy-enhancing tool (see Ramirez et al., 2021;Rueda \&amp; Lara, 2020;Slater et al., 2020;Slater \&amp; Banakou, 2021). Nakamura (2020) refers to the empathy arising through VR experiences as \&quot;toxic empathy\&quot; that only allows privileged people to claim that they have experienced what life is like for the disadvantaged population, but does not lead to changes in people\&\#39;s behavior.The mixed results and perspectives on the use of VR as an empathy machine show that the impact of the technology, on such a multidimensional and complex concept as empathy, is far from being straightforward. However, this evidence also emphasizes the need for further research and evidence-based discussions in relation to the consequences, applications, and VR design factors that can influence the use of this technology as a potential \&quot;empathy-machine\&quot;. The present Research Topic, Virtual Reality and Empathy, aims to contribute to this debate by presenting experimental studies, reviews, and critical opinions in relation to this issue.As part of this article collection, Sora-Domenj\&\#243; (2022) reviews several experimental studies, as well as immersive media experiences, to discuss some of the benefits, risks, and ethical concerns raised by the use of VR in addressing social issues through storytelling and embodiment. This interdisciplinary work concludes that there is no sufficient evidence to claim that VR exposure per se is able to increase empathy and enhance prosocial behaviors towards stigmatized groups. Despite the claims of several film directors and journalists that immersive media can enhance empathy towards underprivileged members, the author demonstrates that there is a concerning lack of research supporting such statements, and appeals to the need for further rigorous scientific research to better understand the short and long-term consequences of immersive media and film VR experiences.On a different view, in an opinion article, Lara and Rueda (2021) challenge Ramirez et al. (2021) ethical rejection of empathy enhancement through VR arguing that in this article there is a misunderstanding of the conception of using VR to \&quot;imagine-other\&quot; versus \&quot;imagine-self\&quot; (Goldie, 2011). Ramirez et al. (2021) argue that it is impossible and unethical to use VR to simulate being another person due to real-life interpersonal disparities and the failure to access someone else\&\#39;s subjectivity (e.g., cognition, attitudes, personality, etc.), concluding that VR is only beneficial for sympathy-based interventions. However, Lara and Rueda (2021) argue that VR can be a very powerful tool to enhance empathy when it is not used to merely pretend to be someone else (i.e., assuming it is impossible to enter into someone else\&\#39;s identity and mind), but rather to seek to get a personal idea of the thoughts and feelings you would experience if you were in the other person\&\#39;s circumstances. They argue that this is effectively achieved through embodiment in VR and proper instructions before going into the VR experience, citing a body of research literature that supports their view.With respect to the use of embodiment in VR as a potential resource to facilitate empathy towards stigmatized groups, as part of the present article collection, Marques et al. (2022) describe a study where they explore how experiencing psychotic symptoms while performing a cognitive task in VR can impact empathy, knowledge, and attitudes towards people with schizophrenia. They report a study conducted with higher education health students and compare their results to only watching these symptoms on a 2D screen. Interestingly, the authors found that both VR and 2D videos seem to be useful tools to enhance empathy towards people with schizophrenia, with VR eliciting more effective attitudes and knowledge-based changes compared to the 2D screen condition.Similarly, this article collection also includes an experimental study realized by Tassinari et al. (2022), where the authors leverage a widely used commercial social VR platform, AltspaceVR, to better understand how positive intergroup contact with an avatar of a stigmatized outgroup (i.e., different race) impacts situational empathy. Despite participants experiencing the illusion of being embodied in their avatar while interacting with other avatars, the authors did not find evidence that positive intergroup contact (i.e., equal group status in a collaborative task) had an effect on empathy measured through self-report questionnaires. However, there were some indications that the experienced level of co-presence in the intergroup contact condition modulated the increase of postintervention empathic feelings, an aspect that deserves further research in future studies.To conclude, in accord with past studies, the experimental evidence, reviews, and discussions included in this article collection confirm that the use of VR to enhance empathy might not be as straightforward as initially assumed, and demands further investigation through rigorous scientific methods in order to better understand under what conditions VR technologies can be beneficial, but also detrimental. It may also be that mediating parameters such as personality traits, culture or political ideology may moderate effects on empathy. In order to move away from the concept of VR as an \&quot;empathy machine\&quot;, which has been scrutinized by many due to its ineffectiveness to lead to changed behavior, authors are introducing new paradigms towards enhancing prosocial behavior rather than simply changing empathy (Slater and Banakou, 2021).},

  abstract = {Responding to  Wanja Wiese 's incisive commentary, I first develop the analogy between predictive processing and scientific discovery. Active inference in the Bayesian brain turns out to be well characterized by abduction (inference to the best explanation), rather than by deduction or induction. Furthermore, the emphasis on control highlighted by cybernetics suggests that active inference can be a process of ``inference to the best prediction'', leading to a distinction between ``epistemic'' and ``instrumental'' active inference. Secondly, on the relationship between perceptual presence and objecthood, I recognize a distinction between the ``world revealing'' presence of phenomenological objecthood, and the experience of ``absence of presence'' or ``phenomenal unreality''. Here I propose that world-revealing presence (objecthood) depends on counterfactually rich predictive models that are necessarily hierarchically deep, whereas phenomenal unreality arises when active inference fails to unmix causes ``in the world'' from those that depend on the perceiver. Finally, I return to control-oriented active inference in the setting of interoception, where cybernetics and predictive processing are most closely connected.},

This work has proven to be informative about behavioral and brain mechanisms that mediate links between perceptual and motor processes invoked during the observation and execution of spatially--temporally coordinated action and interpersonal interaction. The review focuses specifically on processes related to (a) motor experience and expertise, (b) learning and memory, (c) action, intention, and emotion understanding, and (d) audio-visual synchrony and timing. Consideration is given to the relationship between research on dance and more general embodied cognition accounts of action understanding and social cognition. Finally, open questions and issues concerning experimental design are discussed with a view to stimulating future research on social-cognitive aspects of dance.},

  abstract = {We have recently demonstrated that motor execution, observation, and imagery of movements expressing certain emotions can enhance corresponding affective states and therefore could be used for emotion regulation. But which specific movement(s) should one use in order to enhance each emotion? This study aimed to identify, using Laban Movement Analysis (LMA), the Laban motor elements (motor characteristics) that characterize movements whose execution enhances each of the basic emotions: anger, fear, happiness, and sadness. LMA provides a system of symbols describing its motor elements, which gives a written instruction (motif) for the execution of a movement or movement-sequence over time. Six senior LMA experts analyzed a validated set of video clips showing whole body dynamic expressions of anger, fear, happiness and sadness, and identified the motor elements that were common to (appeared in) all clips expressing the same emotion. For each emotion, we created motifs of different combinations of the motor elements common to all clips of the same emotion. Eighty subjects from around the world read and moved those motifs, to identify the emotion evoked when moving each motif and to rate the intensity of the evoked emotion. All subjects together moved and rated 1241 motifs, which were produced from 29 different motor elements. Using logistic regression, we found a set of motor elements associated with each emotion which, when moved, predicted the feeling of that emotion. Each emotion was predicted by a unique set of motor elements and each motor element predicted only one emotion. Knowledge of which specific motor elements enhance specific emotions can enable emotional self-regulation through adding some desired motor qualities to one's personal everyday movements (rather than mimicking others' specific movements) and through decreasing motor behaviors which include elements that enhance negative emotions.},

Compared with traditional human labor, robotic and autonomous systems have advantages such as an intrinsic immunity to the virus and an inability for human-robot-human spread of any disease-causing pathogens, though there are still many technical hurdles for the robotics industry to overcome. This survey comprehensively reviews over 200 reports covering robotic systems which have emerged or have been repurposed during the past several months, to provide insights to both academia and industry. In each chapter, we cover both the advantages and the challenges for each robot, finding that robotics systems are overall apt solutions for dealing with many of the problems brought on by COVID-19, including: diagnosis, screening, disinfection, surgery, telehealth, care, logistics, manufacturing and broader interpersonal problems unique to the lockdowns of the pandemic. By discussing the potential new robot capabilities and fields they applied to, we expect the robotics industry to take a leap forward due to this unexpected pandemic.},

In this chapter, we review studies testing the model in interpersonal and intergroup contexts. We apply the model to conflicts characterized by mutual transgressions and discuss different ways victims' and perpetrators' identities can be restored (e.g., via empowering and accepting messages from the other or a third party, identity-affirmation exercises). We also apply the model to contexts of structural inequality by (a) presenting evidence that intergroup contact that satisfies disadvantaged and advantaged group members' needs for empowerment and acceptance is associated with their support for change, (b) discussing the moderating role of system justification, and (c) integrating our findings with the rank-based perspective on social class. Finally, we discuss the model's boundary conditions and directions for future research.},

On the basis of this general proposition, the authors developed a needs-based model of reconciliation that posits that being a victim is associated with a threat to one's status and power, whereas being a perpetrator threatens one's image as moral and socially acceptable. To counter these threats, victims must restore their sense of power, whereas perpetrators must restore their public moral image. A social exchange interaction in which these threats are removed should enhance the parties' willingness to reconcile. The results of 4 studies on interpersonal reconciliation support these hypotheses. Applied and theoretical implications of this model are discussed.},

The fieldwork components in this study took place over 15 weeks in three phases, with a total of 47 NGO staff members and 35 socio-economically challenged women in rural and urban India. Interviews and co-design sessions with seven proof-of-concept prototypes showed that women appeared to belong to five distinct stages of ``growth'' in striving towards independence. We report the technology design lessons from our co-design sessions to illustrate how user readiness, relationship building at the community and family levels, and integration with state, national and international level programs, should be taken into account in the broader context of intervention design.},

This essay attempts to bring together the insights of recent scholarship in various disciplines in order to outline a general animation model, first presenting some of the characteristics of animation that allow it to draw connections between social, technological, and psychic structures, and then examining some of the ways that the models of animation and performance interact in contemporary subcultural practices.

  abstract = {Active inference offers a unified theory of perception, learning, and decision-making at computational and neural levels of description. In this article, we address the worry that active inference may be in tension with the belief--desire--intention (BDI) model within folk psychology because it does not include terms for desires (or other conative constructs) at the mathematical level of description. To resolve this concern, we first provide a brief review of the historical progression from predictive coding to active inference, enabling us to distinguish between active inference formulations of motor control (which need not have desires under folk psychology) and active inference formulations of decision processes (which do have desires within folk psychology). We then show that, despite a superficial tension when viewed at the mathematical level~of description, the active inference formalism contains terms that are readily identifiable as encoding both the objects of desire and the strength of desire at the psychological level~of description. We demonstrate this with simple simulations of an active inference agent motivated to leave a dark room for different reasons. Despite their consistency, we further show how active inference may increase the granularity of folk-psychological descriptions by highlighting distinctions between drives to seek information versus reward---and how it may also offer more precise, quantitative folk-psychological predictions. Finally, we consider how the implicitly conative components of active inference may have partial analogues (i.e., ``as if'' desires) in other systems describable by the broader free energy principle to which it conforms.},

  abstract = {Objective To model inconsistencies or distortions among three realities: patients' physical reality; clinicians' mental models of patients' conditions, laboratories, etc; representation of that reality in electronic health records (EHR). To serve as a potential tool for quality improvement of EHRs. Methods Using observations, literature, information technology (IT) logs, vendor and US Food and Drug Administration reports, we constructed scenarios/models of how patients' realities, clinicians' mental models, and EHRs can misalign to produce distortions in comprehension and treatment. We then categorized them according to an emergent typology derived from the cases themselves and refined the categories based on insights gained from the literature of interactive sociotechnical systems analysis, decision support science, and human computer interaction. Typical of grounded theory methods, the categories underwent repeated modifications. Results We constructed 45 scenarios of misalignment between patients' physical realities, clinicians' mental models, and EHRs. We then identified five general types of misrepresentation in these cases: IT data too narrowly focused; IT data too broadly focused; EHRs miss critical reality; data multiplicities--perhaps contradictory or confusing; distortions from data reflected back and forth across users, sensors, and others. The 45 scenarios are presented, organized by the five types. Conclusions With humans, there is a physical reality and actors' mental models of that reality. In healthcare, there is another player: the EHR/healthcare IT, which implicitly and explicitly reflects many mental models, facets of reality, and measures thereof that vary in reliability and consistency. EHRs are both microcosms and shapers of medical care. Our typology and scenarios are intended to be useful to healthcare IT designers and implementers in improving EHR systems and reducing the unintended negative consequences of their use.},

  abstract = {The active inference framework, and in particular its recent formulation as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), has gained increasing popularity in recent years as a useful approach for modeling neurocognitive processes. This framework is highly general and flexible in its ability to be customized to model any cognitive process, as well as simulate predicted neuronal responses based on its accompanying neural process theory. It also affords both simulation experiments for proof of principle and behavioral modeling for empirical studies. However, there are limited resources that explain how to build and run these models in practice, which limits their widespread use. Most introductions assume a technical background in programming, mathematics, and machine learning. In this paper we offer a step-by-step tutorial on how to build POMDPs, run simulations using standard MATLAB routines, and fit these models to empirical data. We assume a minimal background in programming and mathematics, thoroughly explain all equations, and provide exemplar scripts that can be customized for both theoretical and empirical studies. Our goal is to provide the reader with the requisite background knowledge and practical tools to apply active inference to their own research. We also provide optional technical sections and multiple appendices, which offer the interested reader additional technical details. This tutorial should provide the reader with all the tools necessary to use these models and to follow emerging advances in active inference research.},

  abstract = {This article introduces narrative analysis as a way of engaging with storied data. Some key assumptions are first unpacked, highlighting the philosophical underpinnings of narrative research. The approach to narrative described in this article derives from narrative constructionism. This assumes that stories do more than simply reflect or recount experience: they act in people's lives in ways that matter deeply. The paper then distinguishes between two broad standpoints for approaching analysis, those of `story analyst' and `storyteller', before going on to describe how to conduct a particular form of constructionist narrative analysis --dialogical narrative analysis. The paper goes on by introducing an emerging trend of thought that attempts to reach beyond the shortcomings of narrative constructionism. That is new materialism. Shifting the analytical focus from stories and narratives to assemblages, new materialism is interested in how narrative and materiality affect each other within networks of human and non-human actors. After discussing what this might mean for researchers, pluralism is presented as an opportunity to combine different analytical worlds in a single study. Finally, an uncommon articulation of pluralism termed diffractive reading is highlighted and exemplified though a study combining narrative dialogism and new materialism. The paper closes with thoughts on the future of narrative in companionship with alternative approaches.},

This mechanism is then formalized in terms of free energy minimization (in unpredicted contexts) where decreases and increases in expected uncertainty are felt as pleasure and unpleasure, respectively. Emphasis is placed on the reasons why such existential imperatives feel like something to and for an organism.},

In this article, I discuss some of these issues, while bringing together Karen Barad's agential realism and Giorgio Agamben's concept of `potentiality' to enhance and refine my analytical approach to real--virtual enactments. This theoretical framework allows me to question the potentialities of gaming, movies and dreams as they enter intra-activities with the comprehensive set of apparatuses that enact a child's agency, subjectivity and relational practices. The analyses and conceptual refinements that I present here are based on empirical data involving interviews with and observations of children between 8 and 14 years of age.},

First, VR poses potential mental health risks, including Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder. Second, VR technology raises serious concerns related to personal neglect of users' own actual bodies and real physical environments. Third, VR technologies may be used to record personal data which could be deployed in ways that threaten personal privacy and present a danger related to manipulation of users' beliefs, emotions, and behaviors. Finally, there are other moral and social risks associated with the way VR blurs the distinction between the real and illusory. These concerns regarding VR naturally raise questions about public policy. The article makes several recommendations for legal regulations of VR that together address each of the above concerns. It is argued that these regulations would not seriously threaten personal liberty but rather would protect and enhance the autonomy of VR consumers.},

Although direct intergroup contact is an effective tool to reduce stigmatization, it is rare in real life and costly to be established in interventions, and the success of traditional media campaigns is debatable. We propose Virtual Reality (VR) as a low-threshold alternative for establishing contact since it involves less barriers for affected and unaffected persons. In a 2 + 1 experiment (n = 114), we compared the effects of encounters with a person with schizophrenia through a VR video with contact through a regular video and no contact at all on anxiety, empathy, social proximity, and benevolence towards people with schizophrenia. We found that contact via VR reduced stigmatization only for participants who liked the person encountered. Our data suggest that it is crucial how participants evaluate the person that they encounter and that stronger perception of spatial presence during reception plays an important role, too. Therefore, we discussvarious boundary conditions that need to be considered in VR interventions and future research on destigmatization towards mental disorders, especially schizophrenia.},

The authors present research findings showing the impact of all of these dimensions on prejudiced attitudes toward several different outgroups.

Based on this study, we report on the achievements as well as on the difficulties of digital fabrication and of ``Making'' in developmental and educational contexts. The benefits are related to an overarching theme of self-expression where the main focus was on dimensions as playfulness, approachable complexity, individualization, immediacy and physicality and collaboration as well as motivation. The problematic aspects were mostly related to socio-technical limitations concerning the themes of orientation and camera control, the lack of coordination and collaboration features, usability and UX issues as well as the construction and limitations of current 3D printers. Based on those findings, we have derived implications for the design and the appropriation of future systems for digital fabrication with children, especially in developmental/educational settings, such as improvements of their collaboration support or better feedback mechanisms regarding the system status towards the end user.},

We conducted an experiment in which teams of two collocated members and one telepresent (remote) member solved a word puzzle requiring a translation key. We varied who had access to the key to examine effects of resource accessibility in distributed groups: in the Robot Information condition, the remote pilot (RP) possessed the key; in the Shared Information condition, all team members possessed the key; in the Local Information condition, only collocated participants (CPs) possessed the key. Audio transcripts were analyzed for differences in the number of words spoken by each team member. RPs spoke significantly less than CPs, especially when they lacked the translation key. RPs perceived greater task difficulty and less ease of communication than CPs. CPs rated other CPs as more trustworthy than RPs. This suggests an imbalance between collocated and remote collaborators that can negatively affect collaboration. We discuss implications for the design and use of telepresence robots in the workplace.},

Here we examined this phenomenon further towards understanding whether other socially marginalized cues (racialization in the likeness of Asian and Black identities), like female-gendering, are associated with the manifestation of dehumanization (e.g., objectification, stereotyping) in human-robot interactions. To that end, we analyzed free-form comments (N = 535) on three videos, each depicting a gynoid - Bina48, Nadine, or Yangyang - racialized as Black, White, and Asian respectively. As a preliminary control, we additionally analyzed commentary (N = 674) on three videos depicting women embodying similar identity cues. The analyses indicate that people more frequently dehumanize robots racialized as Asian and Black, than they do of robots racialized as White. Additional, preliminary evaluation of how people's responding towards the gynoids compares to that towards other people suggests that the gynoids' ontology (as robots) further facilitates the dehumanization.},

  abstract = {Interpersonal synchronization of movements, such as walking at the same pace or dancing to the same beat, can strengthen pro-social behavior and affiliation. People all over the world come together every now and then to become entrained with a shared musical rhythm. Thus, the social and emotional power of music might further tighten interpersonal bonds. In the current study, we investigated whether social entrainment affects affiliation and helpfulness more strongly when tapping to music compared with a metronome. The between-subjects design consisted of four groups: tapping to the beat of music or to an isochronous metronome with an experimenter who tapped synchronously or asynchronously. The results of an implicit test showed that when listening to music, participants were more helpful toward a person who tapped synchronously compared with asynchronously. No such effect was found when listening and tapping to a metronome. The results of explicit ratings of the experimenter's likability, however, did not confirm this effect. Music is a product of social interactions and might even be the result of evolutionary adaptation. Thus, we conclude that interpersonal synchrony or asynchrony during listening to music can fulfill or violate hard-wired social expectations. Compared with the experience of just moving in synchrony with a simple isochronous timekeeper, such as a metronome, social entrainment with music might increase social bonding by adding an extra layer of affective and neurophysiological mechanisms. The current experiment additionally shows that implicit or indirect measures can help elucidate how music, entrainment, affiliation, and pro-social behavior are connected.

In positioning ourselves as critical commentators, we employ the case application to illustrate the Photovoice process of engaging participants in observations and dialogue about their communities; creating a safe environment for critical reflection on current community realities; shifting participants towards action; and facilitating community change. Our critical reflections and descriptions of the processes and steps inherent to Photovoice highlight the value of a youth- and community-centred approach to research.},

Twenty-four individuals rowed on ergometers for 45 min in both individual and group conditions. Half the participants rowed in the group condition with teammates, whereas the other half rowed them with confederates. ANOVA procedures revealed pain tolerance was significantly higher after participating in a group condition than in an individual condition, and that there was no significant difference between a group of strangers and teammates. This higher pain tolerance has been inferred as an indicator of endorphin activity, which may be related to behavioral synchrony.},

In this study, we created a personalization toolkit, which allowed people to customize their Roomba's appearance and distributed it to 15 households. Our observations of these households provide empirical support that personalization can facilitate positive experiences with a Roomba, and having materials to hand can increase the odds of customization. We conclude by discussing design implications for personalization.},

The construction is of fiber-reinforced rubber, and the mechanism is very simple. Gentle miniature robots with no conventional links can be designed using this design. The FMA's basic characteristics and its applications to certain robot mechanisms are presented. Serially connected FMAs act as a miniature robot manipulator. The kinematics and control algorithm for this type of robot are presented. FMAs combined in parallel act as a multifingered robot hand, with each FMA representing a finger. An algorithm for the cooperative control of such FMAs, the stable region for holding, and its performance are presented.{$<>$}},

When users do not share a common metaphorical model for using these technologies, interpersonal communication breakdowns can occur. Through a set of three 8-week-long field deployments and one ongoing observation in-house, we conducted contextual inquiries around the uses of a relatively new communication technology, a mobile remote presence (MRP) system. We observed many nonhuman-like metaphors (e.g., orienting toward the system as a robot, an object) and human-like metaphors (e.g., a person, or a person with disabilities). These metaphors influence people's expectations about social norms in using the systems. We found that there is a serious risk of creating interpersonal conflict when the metaphors are mismatched between people (e.g., locals use nonhuman-like metaphors when remote pilots use human-like metaphors). We explore the implications for understanding remote pilots' rights and responsibilities and present design guidelines for MRP systems that support geographically distributed groups.},

We hypothesize that a child-operated telepresence robot that offers physical participation and operability will help to address this issue. To investigate this hypothesis, we conduct a field experiment with 52 participants (4--8 years old) in classroom environments, and the use of a telepresence robot system is compared with a baseline Skype condition.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Virtual Reality (VR) has often been referred to as an ``empathy machine.'' This is mostly because it can induce empathy through embodiment experiences in outgroup membership. However, the potential of intergroup contact with an outgroup avatar in VR to increase empathy is less studied. Even though intergroup contact literature suggests that less threatening and more prosocial emotions are the key to understanding why intergroup contact is a powerful mean to decrease prejudice, few studies have investigated the effect of intergroup contact on empathy in VR. In this study, we developed a between-participants design to investigate how VR can be used to create a positive intergroup contact with a member of a stigmatized outgroup (ethnic minority) and present the results of the effect of intergroup contact in VR on empathy. Sixty four participants experienced either positive contact (i.e., equal intergroup status, collaborative) with a black (experimenter-controlled) avatar (experimental condition) or no intergroup contact (i.e., ingroup contact with a white avatar; control condition), with situational empathy (personal distress and empathic interest) being measured through a self-report questionnaire up to a week before and right after the VR contact experience. The experiment showed that satisfying degrees of body ownership of participants' own avatar and co-presence with the contacted avatar can be achieved in simple and universally accessible virtual environments such as AltspaceVR. The results indicated that while VR intergroup contact had no significant direct effect on empathy, exploratory analyses indicated that post-intervention empathic interest increased with stronger feelings of co-presence in the intergroup contact condition.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Nevertheless, the results suggest that experiencing negative affects while being embodied in an outgroup member avatar can increase prejudice. We discuss the outcome based on the chosen intergroup perspective (i.e., minority or majority) and target minority groups. An analysis of mediators and moderators is also carried out. We then identify and address the most pressing theoretical and methodical issues concerning VR as a method to reduce prejudice.},

Individuals bring their biases and prejudices with them as they enter virtual spaces. Drawing from theories of real-world interracial interaction, predictable affective, cognitive, and behavioral processes undermine the quality of live interracial interactions. Emerging research using VR suggests that these same challenges occur in virtual social interactions. These challenges can be addressed using evidence-based best practices and policy recommendations: Improving racial/ethnic representation in VR, regulating codes of conduct, ensuring transparency about privacy/consent, and reducing explicit and implicit racist behavior. Following these recommendations can improve VR interracial contact and, in turn, realworld interracial interactions. While VR can serve as a unique tool to bring people together, carefully considered policies must mitigate the negative effects of racial bias that can hinder the progress of improved interracial interactions.},

This proposition was previously examined with Israeli Jewish participants and here is re-examined in three samples, aged 8---17, including Israeli Arabs and two groups from the Palestinian Authority. The three samples were based in different intergroup contexts in which their group status was relatively high, medium or low. The findings demonstrate differences in the relationship between contextually defined collective self-esteem and intergroup attitudes. Results confirmed the hypothesis that in conflict, irrespective of age highest intergroup biases would be displayed by the high status group. However, the hypothesis that the lowest status group would express only more negativity toward the out-group was not confirmed. The developmental hypothesis that pre- and early adolescents from the high status group would express most varied and extreme biases was also confirmed. With some exceptions in the middle status group, all older adolescents displayed moderation in biases.},

A marker based system is used to capture human motion data. From this data we extract the shoulder and elbow joint angles, which uniquely characterize a particular hand gesture. The proposed imitation learning framework aims to generalize over multiple demonstrations of the same hand gesture and thus learn it. The set of joint angle trajectories used for training are first aligned temporally using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and then generalized by weighted averaging. The framework operates in the joint space. The algorithm has been implemented and tested on the Nao Humanoid robot. We also propose a novel method to evaluate the proposed imitation learning framework. We place markers on the robot's arm analogous to the placement of markers on the human subject's arm, and then compare the respective joint angle trajectories.},

Considering the popularity of this approach, one might wonder if the same design principles can be applied in other domains, for instance, visual and fine arts. For this study, a small sample of people, who usually would be just passive spectators of art, was invited to participate in a creative workshop organized by PD principles and to create a fine art themselves. This way, people with only past or little artistic ambitions became ``users, taking control'' rather than passive consumers of an end-product. The participants reflected and documented their feelings before and after the event. Preliminary results suggest that this hybrid approach positively contributes to the relationship dynamics within a formed team and evokes an interest in individual creative activities.},

The theatrical set comes alive in the form of robotic, visual, and sonic elements that allow the actor to extend his range and influence across the stage in unique and dynamic ways. This environment must compellingly assume the behavior and expression of the absent Simon. In order to distill the essence of this character, we recover performance parameters in real time from physiological sensors, voice, and vision systems. These gesture and performance parameters are then mapped to a visual language that incorporates cognitive and semantic models informed by modal relationships. This language allows the off-stage actor to express emotion and interact with others on stage. Our Disembodied Performance system takes a new direction in augmented performance by employing a nonrepresentational abstraction of a human presence that fully translates a character into an environment.},

  abstract = {The minimum frustration principle (MFP) is a computational approach stating that, over the long time scales of evolution, proteins' free energy decreases more than expected by thermodynamical constraints as their amino acids assume conformations progressively closer to the lowest energetic state. This Review shows that this general principle, borrowed from protein folding dynamics, can also be fruitfully applied to nervous function. Highlighting the foremost role of energetic requirements, macromolecular dynamics, and above all intertwined time scales in brain activity, the MFP elucidates a wide range of mental processes from sensations to memory retrieval. Brain functions are compared with trajectories that, over long nervous time scales, are attracted toward the low-energy bottom of funnel-like structures characterized by both robustness and plasticity. We discuss how the principle, derived explicitly from evolution and selection of a funneling structure from microdynamics of contacts, is unlike other brain models equipped with energy landscapes, such as the Bayesian and free energy principles and the Hopfield networks. In summary, we make available a novel approach to brain function cast in a biologically informed fashion, with the potential to be operationalized and assessed empirically. {\copyright} 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Chapter~60is framed by the vision of disaster response: search and rescue robots carrying people from burning buildings or tunneling through collapsed rock falls to reach trapped miners. In this chapter we review tangible progress towards robots that perform routine work in places too dangerous for humans. Researchers still have many challenges ahead of them but there has been remarkable progress in some areas. Hazardous environments present special challenges for the accomplishment of desired tasks depending on the nature and magnitude of the hazards. Hazards may be present in the form of radiation, toxic contamination, falling objects or potential explosions. Technology that specialized engineering companies can develop and sell without active help from researchers marks the frontier of commercial feasibility. Just inside this border lie teleoperated robots for explosive ordnance disposal (EODunderwatertelepresence) and for underwater engineering work. Even with the typical tenfold disadvantage in manipulation performance imposed by the limits of today's telepresence and teleoperation technology, in terms of human dexterity and speed, robots often can offer a~more cost-effective solution. However, most routine applications in hazardous environments still lie far beyond the feasibility frontier. Fire fighting, remediating nuclear contamination, reactor decommissioning, tunneling, underwater engineering, underground mining and clearance of landmines and unexploded ordnance still present many unsolved problems.},

In this paper, I wish to explore more explicitly the connection of boundaries, belonging and landscapes by thinking about how landscapes become spatially bounded scenes that visually communicate what belongs and what does not. My focus is on understanding how landscapes are, in part, constructed through a territorialized politics of belonging-the discourses and practices that establish and maintain discursive and material boundaries that correspond to the imagined geographies of a polity and to the spaces that normatively embody the polity. To explore this relationship, I consider a controversy surrounding the operation of a slaughterhouse in Hugo, Minnesota, which was used extensively for Ua Dab-a Hmong tradition of ritual animal sacrifice. The discourses and practices surrounding efforts to remove the slaughterhouse from Hugo, on the one hand, and to have it remain in Hugo, on the other, offer a case through which to explore the politics of belonging and the boundaries that this creates in constructing landscapes.},

Towards this end, we verified the validity of the scale with telepresence robots using an online video survey. We found differences across different cultures and gender much like other researcher in the past.

Many of these issues are driven by society's struggle to find ways to facilitate deeper and more emotionally meaningful ways to help people connect and overcome the empathy gap which keeps various groups of people apart. This paper presents a process to design for empathy -- as an outcome of design. This extends prior work which typically looks at empathy for design -- as a part of the design process, as is common in inclusive design and human centered design process. We reflect on empathy in design and challenge the often internalised role of the designer to be more externalised, to shift from an empathiser to become an empathy generator. We develop and demonstrate the process to design for empathy through a co-creation case study aiming to bring empathy into politics. The ongoing project is set in the Parliament of Finland, and involves co- creation with six Members of the Parliament from five political parties. Outcomes of the process and case study are discussed, including design considerations for future research.},

Second, we mostly draw on examples from our own research programmes and where relevant from global conflicts and previous studies on allyship to show the applicability of the proposed typology. Finally, we discuss theoretical and practical implications, reflect on the limitations of past studies and suggest directions to address research gaps. Our typology contributes to the collective action and intergroup conflict literatures by showing how allyship action has been studied in conflict settings andthe similarities and differences between conflict and non-conflict settings.},

Our analysis is based on two complementary sets of qualitative data gleaned from in situ experiences of Finnish youth and young adults within the sharing mechanisms of Facebook and Last.fm. In our analysis, we identified social norms that were formed around the prevailing sharing practices in the two sites and compared them in relation to the sharing mechanisms. The analysis revealed that automated and manual sharing were sanctioned differently. We conclude that although the social norms that guide content sharing differed between the two contexts, there was an identical sociocultural goal in profile work: presentation of authenticity.},

  abstract = {Recently design competence has been applied for tackling complex societal challenges. In the context of healthcare service, design competence is especially appreciated in integrating multi-disciplinary professions, providing a solution-oriented platform, and placing everyday people's experiences at the centre of the collaboration. As the codesign tools and mindsets have entered this emerging field of designing for public services, challenges are also reported due to unfamiliarity and cultural differences. In this paper, we present challenges and opportunities of co-designing services with public sector, focusing on two cases of a healthcare service in Finland. Our co-design approach in example cases is based on an empathic design tradition, which allows a human-scale and inclusive perspective towards various stakeholders in a service network.},

The common ingroup identity model predicts that individuals maintain multiple identities at any given time based on roles, demographics, and contextual factors, and that they interpret others based on similarity (i.e., perceived ingroup) or dissimilarity (i.e., perceived outgroup) to these identities. In this experiment, we manipulated two aspects of a virtual partner's identity---race and task collaboration---to determine how users would perceive others in a virtual world. White participants (N = 99) played an anagram game competitively (outgroup) or cooperatively (ingroup) in a virtual environment with a black (outgroup) or white (ingroup) virtual partner. Contrary to hypotheses, performing either task led to more positive evaluations of black avatars than white avatars.},

For this experiment, we designed a novel protocol to induce changes in the robot's group and study different social contexts. In addition, we implemented a perception system to track participants and control the robot's orientation and gaze with little human intervention. The results showed that the gaze behaviors under consideration affected the participants' perception of the robot's motion and that its motion affected human perception of its gaze. This mutual dependency implies that robot gaze and body motion must be designed and controlled jointly, rather than independently of each other. Moreover, the orientation behaviors that we studied led to similar feelings of inclusion and sense of belonging to the robot's group, suggesting that both can be primitives for more complex orientation behaviors.},

Our proposed UTAUT2 incorporates three constructs into UTAUT: hedonic motivation, price value, and habit. Individual differences --- namely, age, gender, and experience --- are hypothesized to moderate the effects of these constructs on behavioral intention and technology use. Results from a two-stage online survey, with technology use data collected four months after the first survey, of 1,512 mobile Internet consumers supported our model Compared to UTAUT, the extensions proposed in UTAUT2 produced a substantial improvement in the variance explained in behavioral intention (56 percent to 74 percent) and technology use (40 percent to 52 percent). The theoretical and managerial implications of these results are discussed.}

Along these lines, we address the problem of bullying in collaboration with children through critical design and Making. Critical and empowering approaches have aroused interest in child computer interaction (CCI) research, while we particularly explore Theatre of the Oppressed as a tool for evaluating design concepts with children and for empowering children to act as agents of change. Different theatre and drama-based methods have been utilized in CCI, while their potential for empowering children remains poorly explored. This study positions Theatre of the Oppressed within critical design and Making process, examines children's experiences with it and scrutinizes in which sense it can be considered empowering, with implications for CCI research and design.},

This paper investigates the antecedents of behavioral intention in the context of mobile based AES. The aim of this study is to identify the important factors influencing the adoption of a mobile based AES in a rural context based on technology acceptance model (TAM). A survey of 327 respondents in rural areas was conducted. Structural equation modeling was employed to empirically test the complex causal relationship of perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease of use (PEOU), social influence (SI), attitude (At), perceived economic wellbeing (PEWB) and behavioral intention (BI). All the six constructs are reliable and valid. The results show that social influence affects attitude, PEOU, PEWB and PU but not BI. Further, PEOU influences PU and attitude, while attitude and PU predicts BI. It also reveals PEOU and PEWB are antecedents to PU. The findings indicate that neither attitude nor BI is impacted by PEWB. A contribution of this research to the existing TAM literature is that perceived economic wellbeing is an antecedent to perceived usefulness. Finally we discuss the implication of these findings for agricultural extension services.},

EDT was motivated by a need to involve several diverse groups of people in the design of a digitally coordinated care service - NetCarers. We used live theatre as a way to engage small groups of participants in dialogues around the design of NetCarers, to qualify their contributions in a refined performance, and to communicate their concerns and aspirations to domain experts. We highlight key benefits to using live theatre in experience-centered design and offer insights for researchers undertaking similar work in the future.},

While the formats of the techniques and contexts explored are diverse, the examples I discuss -- questionable concepts, invisible design and experience design theatre -- have in common the use of provocation to seed discussion, ideation and anticipation. In this chapter I explain the motivations behind these techniques, how we have used them in specific projects, and the ways they have enabled non-designers to engage in meaningful forms of design criticism and to shape the direction of technology design projects. I close the chapter with some reflections on the techniques, drawing out practical learning for how techniques like these might enable designers and participants to play with provocation in future projects.},

This policy commentary assesses what the Trump plan means for the peace process launched in Madrid in 1991. It reviews the evolution of the Madrid/Oslo process with particular emphasis on the underlying principles the Trump plan appears to contradict. It examines Canada's role in the process, assesses Ottawa's initial response to the Trump plan in terms of long-standing Canadian policy and outlines ways in which Canada could influence the debate going forward.},

While digital technology and social media played an important role in the initiation of the movement, it has a negligible role in the movement's on-going practices. Through embedded work with several solidarity structures in Greece, we have begun to understand the `solidarity economy' (SE) as an experiment in direct democracy and self-organization. Working with a range of solidarity structures we are developing a vision for a `Solidarity HCI' committed to designing to support personal, social and institutional transformation through processes of agonistic pluralism and contestation, where the aims and objectives of the SE are continuously re-formulated and put into practice.},

For the past five years, I've turned my attention to the work of community journalists. Sometimes referred to as ``hyperlocal'' journalists, these practitioners have launched news outlets in local communities (Harte, Howell, \&amp; Williams, 2018). They provide an invaluable service, particularly in the light of widespread closures of local newspapers. I had planned an ambitious project focused on traveling around the UK to interview community journalists about their work.

  abstract = {Background This article will look at the viability of the inclusion of mindfulness into the nursing curriculum. In nursing, the environment rarely allows the time for contemplation, though reflection is encouraged specifically in regard to the care we confer on our patients and how that impacts on us professionally. Student nurses are taught to hide their feelings to a point where they cannot find it themselves under their professional armour. Mindfulness is a possible way of bridging this gap. Discussion Our nursing code is geared to safeguard the patient from any harm as well as our colleagues but little is done or said in support of our own personal psychological or emotional health. The helping professions are restricted by legislation which has had an impact of fostering caution and fearfulness. In using mindfulness it can be seen as a possibility in building a bridge between what actually happens in a nurse's professional life and the possibility of reengaging with that internal emotional space. If student nurses begin to incorporate mindfulness techniques, in reality this should make a difference. This was experienced with students doing these exercises, who reported anecdotally feeling more centred. As they have progressed in the course feedback from the students using the techniques has been positive not only for the students but also for them using the skills in a clinical setting, benefiting patients. Conclusion Mindfulness has been used as a part of the modality of health care. It is clear that mindfulness is another way of dealing with the stressors of the modern heath service in which the students are being introduced. Incorporating this coping strategy into the curriculum ensures that students will have the tools to deal with the stressors of the course, which in turn will enhance the student experience.},

  abstract = {Although evidence abounds that people with intellectual disabilities are exposed to stigma and discrimination, few interventions have attempted to tackle stigma among the general public. This study set out to assess the impact of two brief indirect contact interventions on lay people's inclusion attitudes, social distance and positive behavioral intentions, and to explore emotional reactions towards the two interventions. 925 participants completed the first online survey. Participants were randomized to watch either a 10 min film based on intergroup contact theory, or a film based on a protest message. In total, 403 participants completed the follow-up survey at one month. Both interventions were effective at changing inclusion attitudes and social distance in the short term and these effects were partially maintained at one month. The protest based intervention had a greater effect compared to the contact one on aspects of inclusion attitudes and evoked stronger emotional reactions. Despite small effect sizes, brief indirect contact interventions may have a potential role in tackling public stigma associated with intellectual disability but their effects on behavioral intentions are questionable.},

Theories of CMC yield alternative and mutually exclusive explanations about mechanisms by which CMC fosters relationships online with potential to ameliorate prejudice. This research tests contact-hypothesis predictions and two CMC theories on multicultural, virtual groups who communicated during a yearlong online course focusing on educational technology. Groups included students from the three major Israeli education sectors---religious Jews, secular Jews, and Muslims---who completed pretest and posttest prejudice measures. Two sets of control subjects who did not participate in virtual groups provided comparative data. An interaction of the virtual groups experience {\^A} religious/cultural membership affected prejudice toward different religious/cultural target groups, by reducing prejudice toward the respective outgroups for whom the greatest initial enmity existed. Comparisons of virtual group participants to control subjects further support the influence of the online experience. Correlations between prejudice with group identification and with interpersonal measures differentiate which theoretical processes pertained.},

Flexible pneumatic actuators have been broadly explored in soft robotic engineering field where large strokes are required to interface with human body in delicate environments. Some of them have successfully demonstrated the capability of contracting, extending, bending, and/or twisting. This paper presents a precise and effective way of designing a pneumatic bending actuator by using finite element analysis (FEA) modelling and pure winding technique. The proposed pneumatic bending actuator (PBA) is capable of generating satisfactory force and bending displacement upon internal air pressurization, and also maintains low profile, light weight, compliant nature and robustness against pressurization. The prototype actuators with a length of 220 mm, internal diameter of 9 mm and a thickness of 2 mm have been verified to achieve an angular displacement of 171{$^\circ$} at its free end and produce bending force 7.1 N at an operating pressure of 0.675 MPa. Simulation and experimental results were compared and demonstrated good consistency.},

However, in addition to these positive aspects, digital technology also provides an effective medium for spreading hateful content in the form of cyberbullying, bigotry, hateful ideologies, and harassment of individuals and groups. This research aims to investigate the growing body of online hate research (OHR) by mapping general research indices, prevalent themes of research, research hotspots, and influential stakeholders such as organizations and contributing regions. For this, we use scientometric techniques and collect research papers from the Web of Science core database published through March 2019. We apply a predefined search strategy to retrieve peer-reviewed OHR and analyze the data using CiteSpace software by identifying influential papers, themes of research, and collaborating institutions. Our results show that higher-income countries contribute most to OHR, with Western countries accounting for most of the publications, funded by North American and European funding agencies. We also observed increased research activity post-2005, starting from more than 50 publications to more than 550 in 2018. This applies to a number of publications as well as citations. The hotbeds of OHR focus on cyberbullying, social media platforms, co-morbid mental disorders, and profiling of aggressors and victims. Moreover, we identified four main clusters of OHR: (1) Cyberbullying, (2) Sexual solicitation and intimate partner violence, (3) Deep learning and automation, and (4) Extremist and online hate groups, which highlight the cross-disciplinary and multifaceted nature of OHR as a field of research. The research has implications for researchers and policymakers engaged in OHR and its associated problems for individuals and society.},

  abstract = {Karen Barad's (2007) agential realism conceives the world as intra-acting agencies that take definite form only when an agential cut is made. In the information systems discipline, her theory underpins much of the work that goes under the rubric of sociomateriality. Importantly, her work challenges the validity of theories about the world based on representationalism and so-called Cartesian dualism. At least some scholars who subscribe to sociomateriality argue that one consequence of Barad's theory is that information systems theories such as representation theory stand on shaky grounds. I subject this proposition to scrutiny. I begin by summarizing the major tenets of representation theory and agential realism. Next, I use agential realism to provide an account of phenomena that are associated with an accounting information systems case study. I then evaluate the account, particularly from the perspective of what novel, innovative insights occur by using an agential realism lens. Compared to existing theories such as actor-network theory and general systems theory, I conclude that little new is learned. Moreover, I argue that representation theory provides an alternative, robust account of the case-study phenomena. I also consider the question of whether agential realism potentially provides accounting information systems scholars with a means of identifying the core of their field and constructing theories about any core they might identify.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT. Contemporary urban theory has started to question the elevation of diversity as a panacea for enduring urban problems -- segregation, prejudice and intergroup hostility. This critique coincides with an opposite tendency within classic contact theory and research. The latter tradition has developed an increasing enthusiasm for face-to-face interaction. The contact hypothesis, which presupposes established contact, has received conclusive support independent of target groups and contact settings. Research on `lived diversity', which includes both contact and lack of contact, offers two supplementary insights. It shows, on the one hand, that boundaries are inscribed in social spaces. Physical proximity between ethnic and social groups tends to have a minor effect on interaction. Interaction, on the other hand, is not essential to attitude formation. Both subfields within contact research have confirmed that urban space may act as a catalyst for tolerant attitudes. This observation corresponds with increasing recognition of affective states, such as empathy, anxiety and group threat. Contact research has therefore, in summary, transcended the scope of the contact hypothesis. It has expanded into the realm of urban theory, which foreshadows future collaboration between the two traditions. Some key points for such exchange are suggested at the end of the article. Future research should combine an open-ended approach to casual contact with a diversified conception of diversity and a richer conception of urban space. A move in this direction would leave substantial space for geographical research.},

Consequently, social psychological researchers have identified, developed and tested a burgeoning array of different forms of indirect contact, including, extended contact, Electronic- or E-contact, imagined contact, vicarious contact and parasocial contact. In addition to providing a critical review of each of these forms, we argue that indirect contact is more than just a simple ``replacement'' for direct contact, but instead has the potential to improve intergroup relations for both minority and majority members in its own right. Relatedly, we acknowledge that indirect contact occurs within specific normative contexts embodied in legislation, institutions, and media and political contents. In fact, we recognize that indirect contact requires an integrative understanding of the role of intergroup norms and affective processes in order to effectively achieve public policy objectives to optimize effects on prejudice reduction.},

This experiment addresses this limitation through the development and evaluation of a new intergroup harmony program that integrates dual identity and contact tenets. At Time 1, 116 Australian Muslim and 104 Australian Christian first-year high school students attending religiously segregated schools completed pre-test measures of intergroup bias, intergroup anxiety, prejudice, and outgroup knowledge. Eight months later, in the next year of school, these students were allocated to either the nine-week dual identity-electronic or E-contact (DIEC) program that involved Muslim and Christians interacting via a synchronous internet chat tool, or the control condition where they completed the program within their religious groups with no recategorization. All participants completed the same pre-test measures at two weeks (Time 2) and 6-months (Time 3) post-program. At Time 2, for students in the DIEC condition, intergroup bias and intergroup anxiety decreased significantly, and outgroup knowledge increased significantly, compared to the control condition. In the case of intergroup bias, the decrease was maintained at Time 3. Moderation effects of ingroup identification and outgroup friendship, and mediation effects of intergroup anxiety were also found. These encouraging findings highlight that carefully designed E-contact programs can successfully promote intergroup harmony in both the short- and long-term.},

This critical review article introduces a new online contact strategy---Electronic- or E-contact---that allows for physically segregated ingroup and outgroup members to synchronously interact online, in a prestructured format. The synchronous nature of the intergroup interaction allows for the engagement of self in the contact situation that in turn strengthens the effectiveness of E-contact in promoting intergroup harmony. Previous research investigating online contact is reviewed, and an evaluation of a best-practice E-contact framework is provided. This framework is based on the successful 9-week Dual Identity Electronic Contact (DIEC) program that has been shown to maintain reductions in intergroup bias between Muslim and Christian students at 3 time periods: 2 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months post-DIEC intervention. Limitations of the Internet with regard to potentially creating negative contact are also highlighted to offer a balanced critique. Finally, future research designs are proposed to further support and enhance the success of E-contact research to improve intergroup relations and promote peace.},

As predicted, E-contact improved both Catholics' and Protestants' outgroup attitudes via improved contact expectancies and reduced intergroup anxiety.

One new and effective Internet strategy is Electronic- or E-contact. Unlike other contact approaches, E-contact is an experimental intergroup intervention that uniquely accommodates Allport's contact theory and recategorisation processes, to create a structured, cooperative, synchronous and goal-directed online text interaction between members from different groups. E-contact has been found to successfully improve intergroup relations between Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland and Muslims and Catholics in Australia; and reduce bias against lesbian women and gay men, people with schizophrenia, Indigenous Australians, and transgender individuals. This paper discusses the unique engineering and advantages of E-contact interventions in comparison to existing contact strategies, identifies the theories that guide E-contact interventions, provides meta-analytic evidence of its effects, and discusses the strengths, limitations and future directions for E-contact research.},

Meanwhile, personal and professional communication has moved from face-to-face to computer-mediated environments, but there is little understanding on how the characteristics of these environments affect the quality of interaction and joint problem solving. To develop this understanding, methods are needed for measuring success of collaboration. For this purpose, we created a collaborative block design task intended to evaluate and quantify pair performance. In this task, participants need to share information to complete visuospatial puzzles. Two versions of the task are described: a physical version and one that can be completed in virtual reality. A preliminary study was conducted with the physical version (N = 18 pairs) and the results were used to develop the task for a second study in virtual reality (N = 31 pairs). Performance measures were developed for the task, and we found that pair performance was normally distributed and positively associated with visuospatial skills, but not with other participant-specific background factors. The task specifications are released for the research community to apply and adapt in the study of computer-mediated social interaction.},

  abstract = {Hybridity as the essence of puppetry is the key idea that is considered in the article. By reflecting upon aspects of in-betweenness in puppet performing practices, the conceptualization of puppetry's hybridity permits us to overcome a prevalent view that reduces puppetry in terms of binary oppositions such as human/non-human, living/lifeless, tangible/intangible. In this regard, a hybrid perspective of puppetry enables the exploration of the connection between performer and performing object as a synergistic relationship. The three areas discussed in the article manifest some of the major and most influential strategies of performing ontological hybridity in the puppetry of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. The first case focuses on Tadeusz Kantor's bio-objects resulted in his theatre the genetically unique hybrid performer involved in creating the liminal, transgressive and subversive power of theatre. Based on contemporary puppet performances, the second part of the essay examines the ontological consequences of co-sharing and the interactive play of two bodies---the performer and the puppet. The final case deals with practices that merge puppeteering with complex forms of media, digital technologies and virtual environments. The article emphasizes the performative potential of perceptual multi-stability (after Erika Fisher-Lichte) produced by the hybrid puppet performing practices, resulting in the role of viewers as co-creators in puppetry hybridity.},

We show in this context that the Maximum Entropy paradigm for IRL lends itself naturally to the efficient training of deep architectures. At test time, the approach leads to a computational complexity independent of the number of demonstrations, which makes it especially well-suited for applications in life-long learning scenarios. Our approach achieves performance commensurate to the state-of-the-art on existing benchmarks while exceeding on an alternative benchmark based on highly varying reward structures. Finally, we extend the basic architecture - which is equivalent to a simplified subclass of Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCNNs) with width one - to include larger convolutions in order to eliminate dependency on precomputed spatial features and work on raw input representations.},

Our exploratory study focused on the social aspects that might facilitate communication between the elderly and Telenoid's operator. Telenoid elicited positive images and interactive reactions from the elderly with mild dementia, even from those with severe cognitive impairment. They showed strong attachment to its child-like huggable design and became willing to converse with it. Our result suggests that an affectionate bond may be formed between the elderly and the android to provide the operator with easy communication to elicit responses from senior citizens.},

@misc{yansoriConceptTraumaLacanian,
  title = {{The Concept of Trauma in Lacanian Psychoanalysis}},
  author = {Yansori, Ali},
  urldate = {2021-02-28},
  abstract = {``Trauma'' is one of those words about whose meaning there is no consensus; or, to use a Lacanian term, it functions as a point de capiton---that is to say, a word that everyone uses, yet it has no fixed meaning on which everyone agrees---and the constant usage of the word generates the illusion that everyone refers to the same phenomenon whenever the word ``trauma'' is mentioned. Not only has the general public's usage of the word nothing to do with how the word is used in psychoanalytic circles, but every psychoanalytic tradition has its own unique understanding of ``trauma.'' The aim of this article is to show what role trauma plays in Lacanian psychoanalysis. Psychoanalytic thought defines itself in very different terms, in terms of traumas and their persistence. ---Lacan, 1992, p. 10 The Freudian Definition of Trauma Let's start by asking, ``What is trauma?'' The classic definition of the phenomenon can be found in Freud's works; and we could say that Lacan, as a Freudian, would have no general objection to Freud's following definition of ``trauma'': We describe as `traumatic' any excitations from outside which are powerful enough to break through the protective shield. It seems to me that the concept of trauma necessarily implies a connection of this kind with a breach in an otherwise efficacious barrier against stimuli. Such an event as an external trauma is bound to provoke a disturbance on a large scale in the functioning of the organism's energy and to set in motion every possible defensive measure (Freud, 1961, p. 23). Freud's definition appeals to the common sense, so much so that it makes sense even to the layman. And in general, when reading Lacan, we should always keep Freud's definition in mind; however, it needs to be said that Lacan, as usual, adds his own unique twists and turns to Freud's simple definition. Diverging from Freud Given Lacan's reliance on Freud, it is important to point out the relation between neurosis and trauma in Freudian psychoanalysis before we go any further. Freud claims that ``neurosis could [{\dots}] be equated with a traumatic illness and would come about owing to inability to deal with an experience whose affective colouring was excessively powerful'' (Freud, 1963, p. 275). If we accept the Lacanian assumption that there are no ``normal'' people, and that those whom we call normal are in fact neurotic, then it follows that everyone has their own trauma. This last point is crucial since according to Lacan, our traumas make us who we are. The idea that there is an essential substance which outlines our identity (or personality) is not foreign to Western thought; for Lacan, this essential substance is the traumatic kernel that each person possesses. An example from popular culture may help drive the point home: in the TV series Westworld, we find an excellent Lacanian instance of how traumas make us human; consider the following conversation between Bernard and Ford:  	BERNARD: Why would you give me this?  	FORD: A child?  	BERNARD: This child's death{\dots} only a monster would force that onto someone. Why do I return to it over and over? It's my cornerstone, isn't it? The thing my whole identity is organised around{\dots}  	FORD: Yes, Bernard. (Westworld, 2016) [Emphasis added.] This is textbook Lacanian psychoanalysis! It is as if Lacan himself had written the script. We need to keep two crucial points in mind when reading this dialogue: firstly, trauma is precisely the mentioned cornerstone that defines each person's identity; secondly, the words which are used to describe repetitive and circular motions---italicised in the text above---refer to the circular motion of the Trieb [drive] around an objet a. To push my argument further, it could even be argued that in the above dialogue, the word ``thing'' is not without significance: for Lacan, the Thing [la chose, or das Ding], just like objet a, is positioned beyond the Symbolic. As a matter of fact, the two terms are not unrelated: in Lacan's seminars, the concept ``das Ding'' gradually develops into the concept ``objet petit a.'' Repetition, Recollection, and Trauma In his Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis, Lacan takes a Kierkegaardian approach to tell us what trauma is. For Kierkegaard, Wiederholung [repetition] and Erinnerung [recollection] are two sides of the same coin: ``Repetition and recollection are the same movement, except in opposite directions, for what is recollected has been, is repeated backward'' (Kierkegaard, 1983, p. 131). Lacan agrees that these two concepts are related, but only to a certain extent: the limit which Lacan sets for this backward repetition is the Real. In other words, the patient can recollect his past minus the traumatic events. The traumatic events are unsymbolised for the subject; therefore, the subject cannot possibly recall those events; no matter how hard the subject might try, they would not overcome the void created by the trauma they have undergone. Viewed from this perspective, Lacan's approach might not seem strictly Freudian; nevertheless, Freud had understood the limits of recollection despite claiming that ``hysterical symptoms can be resolved if, starting from them, we are able to find the path back to the memory of a traumatic experience'' (Freud, 1962, p. 195). Consider the following passage: ``It is true that in the earliest days of analytic technique we took an intellectualist view of the situation. We set a high value on the patient's knowledge of what he had forgotten, and in this we made hardly any distinction between our knowledge of it and his. We thought it a special piece of good luck if we were able to obtain information about the forgotten childhood trauma from other sources---for instance, from parents or nurses or the seducer himself---as in some cases it was possible to do; and we hastened to convey the information and the proofs of its correctness to the patient, in the certain expectation of thus bringing the neurosis and the treatment to a rapid end (Freud, 1958, p. 141). Here, we see strong similarities between the two thinkers. Freud had realised that secondary accounts of a traumatic event are far more reliable than the patient's own account of the event. In fact, if the patient did ``recall'' something, it would be nothing more than a fantasy woven by the patient himself---a case of false memory. This is where the repetitive motion of the Trieb around the object a comes into play, for this repetitive motion is directly related to trauma. Fantasy is created by the repetitive motion of the Trieb around the objet a: when some (traumatic) event disrupts the symbolic order, a void gets formed in the Symbolic; this void is better known as objet a, and trauma is the disruptive event during which ``the [objet] a is isolated by the Other and it is constituted as a remainder in the subject's relation to the Other'' (Lacan, 2014, p. 114). Thus, fantasy is created around a meaningless void, and its function is to produce the illusion of coherence; as a result, the traumatic event is perceived by the subject as something compatible with the rest of the subject's symbolic universe. With the help of fantasy, each person makes sense of their otherwise meaningless traumatic experience. Therefore, it is not the case that the subject recalls absolutely nothing; the subject does recall something, but this something is not the objective account of the traumatic event. For the subject, the traumatic event is literally non-sense [non-sens] and devoid of meaning. It is the function of fantasy to give meaning, or at least the illusion of meaningfulness, to the meaningless traumatic event: ``The place of the real [{\dots}] stretches from the trauma to the phantasy'' (1998, p. 60), and ``phantasy is never anything more than the screen that conceals something quite primary, something determinant in the function of repetition'' (Lacan, 1998, p. 60). The Trauma of Birth In the TV series Westworld, Bernard was given a traumatic event to make him more humanlike, but you need not worry if your life is less traumatic than Bernard's---that doesn't make you less human than an android. According to Lacan, there is one essential and common trauma that we all share: in his Seminar X, Lacan goes so far as to suggest that getting born is a traumatic experience---he calls this ``le trauma de la naissance'' [the trauma of birth]. We all share this common trauma, because we all emerge into the same ``Other environment.'' The trauma of birth might make us human on a fundamental level, but it doesn't explain why we differ as individuals. If we want to know what makes us unique as individuals, we need to take into consideration the traumas people undergo after birth. Reference  	Freud, S. (1958).

Social exclusion, political conflicts and prolonged military occupation have kept the refugee camps in a perpetual state of marginalization. In this paper we report on our work in Al Amari-- a Palestinian refugee camp adjacent to the city of Ramallah. We examine how the computer club enables the emergence of social ties among residents of the camp and university students acting as tutors. Even though the ties are small-scale and informal, they have the potential to generate new and wider opportunities for exchange that may eventually support more social integration between the camp's marginalized population and the wider Palestinian population.},

In this paper, we present our iterative design approach toward an interactive bidirectional robot intermediaries along with application ideas and design considerations. This study also surveys recent efforts in HCI and HRI that augment multimodal interfaces for computer mediated communication. We conclude by discussing the key lessons we found useful from the system design. The findings for bidirectional telepresence robot interfaces are of: synchronicity, robot's role, intelligence, personalization, and personality construction method.},

Most of our communication with the public gets lost in translation because of the difficulties that science communication poses to scientists. Among other obstacles, differential exposure to scientific and critical thinking, discrepancies with social narratives, and communication training based in the deficit model add on top of a practice established on avoiding emotionality. In this context, effective communication requires the use of emotions, which are crucial to establishing trust. This commentary provides a rationale for collaboration with graphic design and fine arts to use emotions in science communication and education. It starts by proposing the two-way engagement model as a replacement for the deficit model. Next, it offers a neuroscientific basis for the use of emotions in establishing trust. Finally, it finishes profiling the Convergence Initiative's efforts to establish bridges across disciplines and communicating science with the public through art.},

  abstract = {We investigate the visual cross-embodiment imitation setting, in which agents learn policies from videos of other agents (such as humans) demonstrating the same task, but with stark differences in their embodiments -- shape, actions, end-effector dynamics, etc. In this work, we demonstrate that it is possible to automatically discover and learn vision-based reward functions from cross-embodiment demonstration videos that are robust to these differences. Specifically, we present a self-supervised method for Cross-embodiment Inverse Reinforcement Learning (XIRL) that leverages temporal cycle-consistency constraints to learn deep visual embeddings that capture task progression from offline videos of demonstrations across multiple expert agents, each performing the same task differently due to embodiment differences. Prior to our work, producing rewards from self-supervised embeddings typically required alignment with a reference trajectory, which may be difficult to acquire under stark embodiment differences. We show empirically that if the embeddings are aware of task progress, simply taking the negative distance between the current state and goal state in the learned embedding space is useful as a reward for training policies with reinforcement learning. We find our learned reward function not only works for embodiments seen during training, but also generalizes to entirely new embodiments. Additionally, when transferring real-world human demonstrations to a simulated robot, we find that XIRL is more sample efficient than current best methods.

The interface provided a setting for face-to-face shared narration and support for the management of disagreements. The interface allows for escalation and de-escalation of the conflict emerging in the shared narration and requires that participants perform joint actions when a contribution to the story is to be removed from the overall narration. A between-subjects experiment compared the tabletop interface and a desktop multimedia interface with mixed pairs (male Israeli-Jewish and Palestinian-Arab youth). The results demonstrated that the experience with the tabletop interface appears to be motivating and, most importantly, produces at least a short-term shift of attitude toward the other.},

In this work, we present an automated approach to support remote interactions between pairs of participants as they contribute to a shared story in their own language. A key component is an automated cognitive tutor that guides the participants through a controlled escalation/de-escalation process during the development of a joint narrative. We performed a controlled study comparing a trained human mediator to the automated mediator. The results demonstrate that an automated mediator, although simple at this stage, effectively supports interactions and helps to achieve positive outcomes comparable to those attained by the trained human mediator.},

Inspired by the recent success of deep learning in bridging the semantic gap, this paper proposes to bridge the emotional gap based on a multimodal Deep Convolution Neural Network (DCNN), which fuses the audio and visual cues in a deep model. This multimodal DCNN is trained with two stages. First, two DCNN models pretrained on large-scale image data are fine-tuned to perform audio and visual emotion recognition tasks respectively on the corresponding labeled speech and face data. Second, the outputs of these two DCNNs are integrated in a fusion network constructed by a number of fully-connected layers. The fusion network is trained to obtain a joint audio-visual feature representation for emotion recognition. Experimental results on the RML audio-visual database demonstrates the promising performance of the proposed method. To the best of our knowledge, this is an early work fusing audio and visual cues in DCNN for emotion recognition. Its success guarantees further research in this direction.},

Mode of copresence refers to the physical conditions that structure human interaction. Six such conditions are delineated. Sense of copresence, on the other hand, refers to the subjective experience of being with others that an individual acquires in interaction. The main argument of this paper is that mode of copresence affects sense of copresence, and knowledge of how the former affects the latter will benefit copresence design.},

The aggregate relationship between extended contact and intergroup attitudes was r = .25, 95\% confidence interval (CI) = [.22, .27], which reduced to r = .17, 95\% CI = [.14, .19] after removing direct friendship's contribution; these results suggest that extended contact's hypothesized relationship to intergroup attitudes is small-to-medium and exists independently of direct friendship. This relationship was larger when extended contact was perceived versus actual, highlighting the importance of perception in extended contact. Current results on extended contact mostly resembled their direct friendship counterparts, suggesting similarity between these contact types. These unique insights about extended contact and its relationship with direct friendship should enrich and spur growth within this literature.},

Results from an initial evaluation with 3 participants with spinal cord injury (SCI), of varied injury levels and years since injury, wearing and controlling the glove show an average of 87\% improvement in grasping force, and improvements in functional assessments for participants with recent injuries. A significant variation in response suggests further investigation is required to understand the adaptation needed across different injury levels and durations since injury.
